@article{Ortiz2014Selfassembly,
    abstract = {The lock-and-key colloidal particles of Sacanna et al. are novel "dynamic" building blocks consisting of a central spherical colloidal particle (key) attached to a finite number of dimpled colloidal particles (locks) via depletion interactions strong enough to bind the particles together but weak enough that the locks are free to rotate around the key. This rotation imbues a mechanical reconfigurability to these colloidal "molecules". Here we use molecular simulation to predict that these lock-and-key building blocks can self-assemble into a wide array of complex crystalline structures that are tunable via a set of reconfigurability dimensions: the number of locks per building block, bond length, size ratio, confinement, and lock mobility. We demonstrate that, with reconfigurability, ordered structures - such as random triangle square tilings - assemble, despite being kinetically inaccessible with non-reconfigurable but similar building blocks.},

@article{Barnes1997Thixotropya,
    abstract = {The ensuing mechanical response to stressing or straining a structured liquid results in various viscoelastic phenomena, either in the linear region where the microstructure responds linearly with respect to the stress and strain but does not itself change, or in the nonlinear region where the microstructure does change in response to the imposed stresses and strains, but does so reversibly. The complication of thixotropy arises because this reversible, microstructural change itself takes time to come about due to local spatial rearrangement of the components. This frequently found time-response of a microstructure that is itself changing with time makes thixotropic, viscoelastic behaviour one of the greatest challenges facing rheologists today, in terms of its accurate experimental characterisation and its adequate theoretical description. Here a history of thixotropy is given, together with a description of how it is understood today in various parts of the scientific community. Then a mechanistic description of thixotropy is presented, together with a series of applications where thixotropy is important. A list of different examples of thixotropic systems is then given. Finally the various kinds of theories that have been put forward to describe the phenomenon mathematically are listed.},

@article{Song1990Kinetics,
    abstract = {The influence of initiator concentration, monomer/water ratio, reaction temperature, and agitator speed on the kinetic behavior of emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization of styrene with potassium persulfate initiator has been investigated. Polymerization rate and the particle number increased with increasing initiator concentration and reaction temperature. The particle size distribution became broader as the initiator concentration decreased. Monomer conversion, at a common time, was smaller when the initial monomer/water ratio was increased. Particle size, at the same conversion, increased with an increasing initial monomer charge. High agitator speed caused significant particle coagulation. As a result, a smaller number of larger particles with broad size distribution were produced when the agitation was intense. Reaction rate decreased with increasing agitator speed. The two-stage model developed in this paper can describe the kinetics of emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization of styrene when potassium persulfate is used as initiator. Values of the termination rate constant, ktp, obtained from fitting the model to the experimental data are in agreement with ktp data reported in the literature for emulsion polymerization. ktp increases with increasing agitator speed because of a reduced gel effect. The rate coefficient for particle coagulation, Kf, increases with decreasing initiator concentration, with decreasing reaction temperature and with increasing agitator speed. The rate coefficient for radical capture by particles, kc, increases with increasing reaction temperature and with increasing agitator speed.},

@article{Zoldesi2006Deformable,
    abstract = {A procedure to obtain hollow colloidal particles has been developed using an emulsion templating technique. Monodisperse silicone oil droplets were prepared by hydrolysis and polymerization of dimethyldiethoxysilane monomer and incorporated in a solid shell using tetraethoxysilane. Hollow shells were obtained by exchange of the core. The formation of the oil droplets was investigated using static light scattering and {29Si} solution {NMR}, and the hollow shells were characterized by electron microscopy and static light scattering. Details on the composition of the shell material were obtained from energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and {29Si} solid state {NMR}, revealing that the shells consist of a hybrid cross-linked network of silica and siloxane units. Confocal microscopy was used to show that the shells are permeable to small dye molecules. The thickness of the coating can be easily varied from a few nanometers upward. Depending on the ratio of shell thickness to particle radius, three types of hollow shells can be distinguished depending on the way in which they buckle upon drying. We designate them as microspheres, microcapsules, and microballoons. As a result of their monodispersity, these particles can be used for making {3D}-ordered materials.},

Experimentally, we find the formation of a wormlike fluid phase in which the bowl-shaped particles have a strong tendency to stack on top of each other. However, using free energy calculations in computer simulations, we show that the wormlike phase is out-of-equilibrium and that the columnar phase is thermodynamically stable for sufficiently deep bowls and high densities. In addition, we employ a novel technique based on simulated annealing to predict the crystal structures for shallow bowls. We find four exotic new crystal structures and we determine their region of stability using free energy calculations. We discuss the implications of our results for the development of materials consisting of molecular mesogens or nanoparticles.},

Spherical caps of sufficiently large radius of curvature exhibit a transition from the isotropic to the nematic discotic phase. By reducing the radius further, however, the latter phase is no longer stable, and the isotropic phase evolves into a different phase characterized by the simultaneous aggregation of the centers of the parent spheres and the organization of the concave particles on the corresponding and interpenetrating spherical surfaces. Contact lens-like particles thus exhibit a competition between a fluid?fluid phase transition and a clustering phenomenon, similar to what is observed in colloidal suspensions forming cluster phases or molecular systems forming micelles. For contact lens-like particles, however, this competition does not involve any energetic contribution and is purely entropy driven.},

We developed a dual-view, plane illumination microscope with improved spatiotemporal resolution by switching illumination and detection between two perpendicular objectives in an alternating duty cycle. Computationally fusing the resulting volumetric views provides an isotropic resolution of 330 nm. As the sample is stationary and only two views are required, we achieve an imaging speed of 200 images/s (i.e., 0.5 s for a 50-plane volume). Unlike spinning-disk confocal or Bessel beam methods, which illuminate the sample outside the focal plane, we maintain high spatiotemporal resolution over hundreds of volumes with negligible photobleaching. To illustrate the ability of our method to study biological systems that require high-speed volumetric visualization and/or low photobleaching, we describe microtubule tracking in live cells, nuclear imaging over 14 h during nematode embryogenesis and imaging of neural wiring during Caenorhabditis elegans brain development over 5 h.},

    abstract = {Colloidal silica spheres bearing grafted octadecyl chains dispersed in hexadecane undergo a sol-gel transition with decreasing temperature. The gelation temperature depends on the volume fraction φ and, perhaps, the particle size. For {φ>φgel(T}), the value at the transition, the elastic modulus varies as (φ-φgel)s with the prefactor and exponent independent of temperature. This form resembles prediction from static percolation theories, but the exponent s=3.0±0.5 lies significantly below those expected and the transition volume fraction varies with temperature. The relationship of the gelation transition to dynamic percolation and phase transitions predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics has also been addressed. Matching the calculated structure factor for adhesive spheres with that measured by static light scattering yields the unknown strength of the interparticle attraction as a function of temperature. Though an imperfect fit introduces considerable uncertainty, this empirical relationship distinguishes the gel transition from both the dynamic percolation threshold and the spinodal associated with the fluid-fluid transition for adhesive spheres. Thus we conclude that gelation in this colloidal dispersion corresponds to a metastable state lying between the fluid-solid phase boundary and the spinodal.},

Poly(butyl acrylate) particles with controlled size and size distribution (monodisperse), and gel content were successfully prepared in a 90/10 methanol/water medium. It was found that the particle size decreased with increasing initiator concentration. This is the opposite of what was previously reported in the dispersion polymerizations of styrene and methyl methacrylate. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Chen2014Extending,
    abstract = {Particle tracking, the analysis of individual moving elements in time series of microscopic images, enables burgeoning new applications, but there is need to better resolve conformation and dynamics. Here we describe the advantages of Delaunay triangulation to extend the capabilities of particle tracking in three areas: (1) discriminating irregularly shaped objects, which allows one to track items other than point features; (2) combining time and space to better connect missing frames in trajectories; and (3) identifying shape backbone. To demonstrate the method, specific examples are given, involving analyzing the time-dependent molecular conformations of actin filaments and ?-{DNA}. The main limitation of this method, shared by all other clustering techniques, is the difficulty to separate objects when they are very close. This can be mitigated by inspecting locally to remove edges that are longer than their neighbors and also edges that link two objects, using methods described here, so that the combination of Delaunay triangulation with edge removal can be robustly applied to processing large data sets. As common software packages, both commercial and open source, can construct Delaunay triangulation on command, the methods described in this paper are both computationally efficient and easy to implement.},

@article{Anthony2014ΤFCS,
    abstract = {Fluorescence fluctuation methods have become invaluable research tools for characterizing the molecular-level physical and chemical properties of complex systems, such as molecular concentrations, dynamics, and the stoichiometry of molecular interactions. However, information recovery via curve fitting analysis of fluctuation data is complicated by limited resolution and challenges associated with identifying accurate fit models. We introduce a new approach to fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy that couples multi-modal fluorescence measurements with multi-modal global curve fitting analysis. This approach yields dramatically enhanced resolution and fitting model discrimination capabilities in fluctuation measurements. The resolution enhancement allows the concentration of a secondary species to be accurately measured even when it constitutes only a few percent of the molecules within a sample mixture, an important new capability that will allow accurate measurements of molecular concentrations and interaction stoichiometry of minor sample species that can be functionally important but difficult to measure experimentally. We demonstrate this capability using {\"{I}FCS}, a new fluctuation method which uses simultaneous global analysis of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime data, and show that {\"{I}FCS} can accurately recover the concentrations, diffusion coefficients, lifetimes, and molecular brightness values for a two component mixture over a wide range of relative concentrations.},

The manufacture of such particles is best carried out in the solvent of choice for the {EPD}. This opens up new interests in the study of nonaqueous dispersion polymerization methods, which deliver polymer particles suspended in low dielectric constant solvents. We explore in this article the use of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) macromonomer for the stabilization of poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer particles in dodecane, a typical solvent of choice for {EPDs}. The use of this stabilizer is significant for this method as it is directly soluble in the reaction medium as opposed to traditionally used poly(12-hydroxystearic acid)-based stabilizers. Additionally, the present study serves as a baseline for subsequent work, where nonaqueous dispersion polymerization will be used to create polymer particles encapsulating liquid droplets and solid pigment particles. In this article, the influence of the macromonomer molecular weight and concentration on the properties of the synthesized particles is studied. In addition, we investigate the possibility of synthesizing polymer particles from other monomers both as a comonomer for methyl methacrylate and as the only monomer in the process. The influence of macromonomer concentration is also studied throughout all experiments.},

@article{Hsu2005Charge,
    abstract = {While the important role of electrostatic interactions in aqueous colloidal suspensions is widely known and reasonably well-understood, their relevance to nonpolar suspensions remains mysterious. We measure the interaction potentials of colloidal particles in a nonpolar solvent with reverse micelles. We find surprisingly strong electrostatic interactions characterized by surface potentials, |e?|, from 2.0 to 4.4 {kBT} and screening lengths, ?-1, from 0.2 to 1.4 ?m. Interactions depend on the concentration of reverse micelles and the degree of confinement. Furthermore, when the particles are weakly confined, the values of |e?| and ? extracted from interaction measurements are consistent with bulk measurements of conductivity and electrophoretic mobility. A simple thermodynamic model, relating the structure of the micelles to the equilibrium ionic strength, is in good agreement with both conductivity and interaction measurements. Since dissociated ions are solubilized by reverse micelles, the entropic incentive to charge a particle surface is qualitatively changed from aqueous systems, and surface entropy plays an important role.},

Here, in a second part to that review, we survey effects due to softness in the interparticle potential, which necessitates the use of an effective volume fraction. We review current experimental systems, and conclude that the one that most closely approximates hard spheres remains polymethylmethacrylate spheres sterically stabilised by polyhydroxystearic acid 'hairs'. For these particles their effective hard sphere diameter is around 1-10\% larger than the core diameter, depending on the particle size. We argue that for larger colloids suitable for confocal microscopy, the effect of electrostatic charge cannot be neglected, so that mapping to hard spheres must be treated with caution.},

@article{Haward2012Extensional,
    abstract = {Wormlike micellar surfactant solutions are encountered in a wide variety of important applications, including enhanced oil recovery and ink-jet printing, in which the fluids are subjected to high extensional strain rates. In this contribution we present an experimental investigation of the flow of a model wormlike micellar solution (cetyl pyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate in deionised water) in a well-defined stagnation point extensional flow field generated within a microfluidic cross-slot device. We use micro-particle image velocimetry ([small mu ]-{PIV}) and full-field birefringence microscopy coupled with macroscopic measurements of the bulk pressure drop to make a quantitative characterization of the fluid's rheological response over a wide range of deformation rates. The flow field in the micromachined cross-slot is first characterized for viscous flow of a Newtonian fluid, and [small mu ]-{PIV} measurements show the flow field remains symmetric and stable up to moderately high Reynolds number, Re [approximate] 20, and nominal strain rate, [small epsi, Greek, dot above]nom [approximate] 635 s-1. By contrast, in the viscoelastic micellar solution the flow field remains symmetric only for low values of the strain rate such that [small epsi, Greek, dot above]nom [less-than-or-equal] [small {lambda]M}-1, where [small {lambda]M} = 2.5 s is the Maxwell relaxation time of the fluid. In this stable flow regime the fluid displays a localized and elongated birefringent strand extending along the outflow streamline from the stagnation point, and estimates of the apparent extensional viscosity can be obtained using the stress-optical rule and from the total pressure drop measured across the cross-slot channel. For moderate deformation rates ([small epsi, Greek, dot above]nom [greater-than-or-equal] [small {lambda]M}-1) the flow remains steady, but becomes increasingly asymmetric with increasing flow rate, eventually achieving a steady state of complete anti-symmetry characterized by a dividing streamline and birefringent strand connecting diagonally opposite corners of the cross-slot. Eventually, as the nominal imposed deformation rate is increased further, the asymmetric divided flow becomes time dependent. These purely elastic instabilities are reminiscent of those observed in cross-slot flows of polymer solutions, but seem to be strongly influenced by the effects of shear localization of the micellar fluid within the microchannels and around the re-entrant corners of the cross-slot.},

Here we show that the use of these asymmetric kernels creates significant artifacts, distorting apparent particle positions in a way that gives the artificial appearance of orientational crystalline order, even in such fully-disordered isotropic systems as simple fluids of hard-sphere-like colloids. We rectify this problem by replacing all asymmetric kernels with rotationally-symmetric kernels, which does not impact code performance. We show that these corrected codes locate particle positions properly, restoring measured isotropy to colloidal fluids.

@article{Liber2013Dense,
    abstract = {We relate, by simple analytical centrifugation experiments, the density of colloidal fluids with the nature of their randomly packed solid sediments. We demonstrate that the most dilute fluids of colloidal hard spheres form loosely packed sediments, where the volume fraction of the particles approaches in frictional systems the random loose packing limit, {φRLP} = 0.55. The dense fluids of the same spheres form denser sediments, approaching the so-called random close packing limit, {φRCP} = 0.64. Our experiments, where particle sedimentation in a centrifuge is sufficiently rapid to avoid crystallization, demonstrate that the density of the sediments varies monotonically with the volume fraction of the initial suspension. We reproduce our experimental data by simple computer simulations, where structural reorganizations are prohibited, such that the rate of sedimentation is irrelevant. This suggests that in colloidal systems, where viscous forces dominate, the structure of randomly close-packed and randomly loose-packed sediments is determined by the well-known structure of the initial fluids of simple hard spheres, provided that the crystallization is fully suppressed.},

@article{Wang2013TrackAWorm,
    abstract = {A major challenge of neuroscience is to understand the circuit and gene bases of behavior. C. elegans is commonly used as a model system to investigate how various gene products function at specific tissue, cellular, and synaptic foci to produce complicated locomotory and bending behavior. The investigation generally requires quantitative behavioral analyses using an automated single-worm tracker, which constantly records and analyzes the position and body shape of a freely moving worm at a high magnification. Many single-worm trackers have been developed to meet lab-specific needs, but none has been widely implemented for various reasons, such as hardware difficult to assemble, and software lacking sufficient functionality, having closed source code, or using a programming language that is not broadly accessible. The lack of a versatile system convenient for wide implementation makes data comparisons difficult and compels other labs to develop new worm trackers. Here we describe {Track-A}-Worm, a system rich in functionality, open in source code, and easy to use. The system includes plug-and-play hardware (a stereomicroscope, a digital camera and a motorized stage), custom software written to run with Matlab in Windows 7, and a detailed user manual. Grayscale images are automatically converted to binary images followed by head identification and placement of 13 markers along a deduced spline. The software can extract and quantify a variety of parameters, including distance traveled, average speed, distance/time/speed of forward and backward locomotion, frequency and amplitude of dominant bends, overall bending activities measured as root mean square, and sum of all bends. It also plots worm travel path, bend trace, and bend frequency spectrum. All functionality is performed through graphical user interfaces and data is exported to clearly-annotated and documented Excel files. These features make {Track-A}-Worm a good candidate for implementation in other labs.},

Beyond a certain concentration, the system is said to be a colloidal glass; structurally, the system resembles a liquid, yet motions within the suspension are slow enough that it can be considered essentially frozen. For several decades, colloids have served as a valuable model system for understanding the glass transition in molecular systems. The spatial and temporal scales involved allow these systems to be studied by a wide variety of experimental techniques. The focus of this review is the current state of understanding of the colloidal glass transition, with an emphasis on experimental observations. A brief introduction is given to important experimental techniques used to study the glass transition in colloids. We describe features of colloidal systems near and in glassy states, including increases in viscosity and relaxation times, dynamical heterogeneity and ageing, among others. We also compare and contrast the glass transition in colloids to that in molecular liquids. Other glassy systems are briefly discussed, as well as recently developed synthesis techniques that will keep these systems rich with interesting physics for years to come.},

This constraint can frustrate the system, leading to oblique crystal lattices or to structures with a chiral seam known as a 'line slip' phase, neither of which is stable for isotropic particles in equilibrium on flat surfaces. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to find the steady-state structure of spherical particles with short-range repulsion and long-range attraction far below the melting temperature. We vary the range of attraction using the {Lennard-Jones} and Morse potentials and find that a shorter-range attraction favors the line-slip. We develop a simple model based only on geometry and bond energy to predict when the crystal or line-slip phases should appear, and find reasonable agreement with the simulations. The simplicity of this model allows us to understand the influence of the commensurability constraint, an understanding that might be extended into the more general problem of self-assembling particles in strongly confined spaces.},

We investigate the parameter region where the coverage (defined as the ratio between attractive and total surface) varies from 50\% (the Janus case) to zero (hard-sphere). Simulation results indicate that on decreasing the coverage, particles self-assemble into clusters of different shapes, from micelles close to the Janus case, to one and two dimensional aggregates (wires and lamellae) for smaller coverage. Close to the hard-sphere limit, small micelles and dimers dominate the scene. We never find evidence of a gas-liquid (colloidal-rich/colloidal-poor) phase separation: it confirms that self-assembly into clusters which expose to their neighbors mostly repulsive surfaces suppresses phase separation and stabilizes cluster phases.},

                We demonstrate a novel method for measuring the microrheology of soft viscoelastic media, based on cross correlating the thermal motion of pairs of embedded tracer particles. The method does not depend on the exact nature of the coupling between the tracers and the medium, and yields accurate rheological data for highly inhomogeneous materials. We demonstrate the accuracy of this method with a guar solution, for which other microscopic methods fail due to the polymer's mesoscopic inhomogeneity. Measurements in an F-actin solution suggest conventional microrheology measurements may not reflect the true bulk behavior.

@article{Bhardwaj2007Filament,
    abstract = {A filament stretching extensional rheometer and capillary breakup extensional rheometer are used to measure the extensional rheology of a series of wormlike micelle solutions experiencing a uniaxial elongational flow. The experiments are performed using a series of wormlike micelle solutions of both cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate ({NaSal}) in an aqueous sodium chloride solution and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and {NaSal} in de-ionized water. The linear viscoelasticity of all the wormlike micelle solutions is well described by a Maxwell model with just one or two relaxation times while the steady shear measurements all demonstrate characteristics of shear banding at large shear rates. In transient homogeneous uniaxial extension imposed by a filament stretching rheometer, each of the wormlike micelle solutions demonstrate significant strain hardening. At large extension rates, the wormlike micelle solution filaments are all found to fail through a dramatic rupture near the axial midplane at a constant stress independent of imposed extension rate. The result is an extensional viscosity that decays linearly with increasing extension rate. This filament failure likely stems from the local scission of individual wormlike micelle chains. For the more concentrated solutions, as the imposed extension rate is reduced, a critical extension rate is found below which the filament does not rupture, but instead elastocapillary pinch off is recovered and the elastic tensile stresses achieved in the fluid filament grow far beyond the value observed at rupture. This dramatic upturn in the elastic tensile stress and the extensional viscosity at low extension rates is not intuitively expected and is most likely a result of structural changes to the entangled wormlike micelle solution. Strain hardening is also observed in capillary breakup rheometry experiments, however, when the results of filament stretching and capillary breakup rheometry measurements at nominally the same extension rate are superimposed, the results do not agree; the extensional viscosity measurements from filament stretching are in some instances more than an order of magnitude larger. This result calls into question the use of capillary breakup rheometry for quantitatively measuring the extensional viscosity of wormlike micelle solutions.

The chains sometimes have more than 30 particles, and we call them ?polloidal chains?. A key aspect of the work is the careful modeling of the interparticle forces between partially flattened polystyrene spheres. This modeling helped us to identify a narrow window of system conditions that produce interparticle physical bonds with a bond energy greater than {15kT}, as well as a gap of fluid between particles that enables freely rotating bonds and flexible chains. The formation of the chains is well-modeled using linear condensation growth from classical polymer theory, suggesting that the chains might be used experimentally as large-scale, relatively slow moving models for polymer chains.},

In particular, it is demonstrated experimentally that the ionic strength of the aqueous phase plays a major role in controlling particle size and that the free radicals produced by thermal decomposition of the initiator become incorporated as end-groups on the polymer chains and hence form the surface groups on the particle. A theoretical explanation is given which indicates the reasons for the importance of ionic strength in controlling particle size.},

A method has now been developed using an extension of this procedure to prepare latices with sizes in the range 1 to 4 µm. The method involves the polymerization of monomer in the presence of seed latex particles.
                          Data are also presented for the rate of swelling of latex particles by monomer and for the rate of swelling of polymer freshly deposited on to latex particles. Both processes were found to be too slow to give a satisfactory explanation of the kinetics of particle growth. However, from an examination of the variation of the seed number concentration at constant temperature, monomer, initiator and electrolyte conditions, it was concluded that the heterocoagulation of the freshly formed particles on to the seed particles constituted the basic particle growth mechanism.

@article{Morrison1993Electrical,
    abstract = {From an explosion at Shell's refinery at Pernis to the megahertz oscillations of an electrically charged micelle in hexane to the most advanced of electronic imaging processes, electric charges in nonaqueous media make their presence known. The study of these electric charges has slowly and steadily increased over the last 50 years or so, but the answers to the elementary questions about how charged species are created and how they remain charged are still hotly debated. This review concentrates on the low conductivity solutions and dispersions typical of hydrocarbon media. The model generally accepted for nonaqueous electrolyte solutions is that the electric charges are stabilized against neutralization by being held separate in large structures, such as micelles or complex macroions. Electrical conductivity arises by the field-induced motion of these charged species. The electric-field and concentration dependence of the conductivity depend strongly on their size and structure. Particles acquire electrical charges either by preferentially adsorbing the ion of one sign or the other, possibly still associated with its stabilizing structure, or by an ion dissociating from its surface to be held in some lyophilic structure in the nonaqueous medium. Many aspects of this model are not universally accepted. The influence of water on the creation and stabilization of electrical charges is reviewed. Water plays a key role in the properties of nonaqueous electrolyte solutions and dispersions but its behavior is complex because it influences both the formation of structures such as micelles, the dissociation of ionic molecules, and reactions on particle surfaces. The current theories of the physics of nonaqueous electrolyte solutions and dispersions are reviewed. This review is presented in the form of discussions of twenty-two related topics.},

    abstract = {Understanding and, ultimately, controlling the properties of amorphous materials is one of the key goals of material science. Among the different amorphous structures, a very important role is played by colloidal gels. It has been only recently understood that colloidal gels are the result of the interplay between phase separation and arrest. When short-ranged attractive colloids are quenched into the phase-separating region, density fluctuations are arrested and this results in ramified amorphous space-spanning structures that are capable of sustaining mechanical stress. We present a mechanism of aggregation through arrested demixing in binary colloidal mixtures, which leads to the formation of a yet unexplored class of materials––bigels. This material is obtained by tuning interspecies interactions. Using a computer model, we investigate the phase behavior and the structural properties of these bigels. We show the topological similarities and the geometrical differences between these binary, interpenetrating, arrested structures and their well-known monodisperse counterparts, colloidal gels. Our findings are supported by confocal microscopy experiments performed on mixtures of {DNA}-coated colloids. The mechanism of bigel formation is a generalization of arrested phase separation and is therefore universal.},

Monodisperse particle populations, ranging from sub-200 nm nanoparticles to complex micron-scale objects, have been fabricated and harvested. {PRINT} uses low-surface energy, chemically resistant fluoropolymers as molding materials, which eliminates the formation of a residual interconnecting film between molded objects. Until now, the presence of this film has largely prevented particle fabrication using soft lithography. Importantly, we have demonstrated that {PRINT} affords the simple, straightforward encapsulation of a variety of important bioactive agents, including proteins, {DNA}, and small-molecule therapeutics, which indicates that {PRINT} can be used to fabricate next-generation particulate drug-delivery agents.},

    abstract = {We study the vibrational modes of three-dimensional jammed packings of soft ellipsoids of revolution as a function of particle aspect ratio ε and packing fraction. At the jamming transition for ellipsoids, as distinct from the idealized case using spheres where ε=1, there are many unconstrained and nontrivial rotational degrees of freedom. These constitute a set of zero-frequency modes that are gradually mobilized into a new rotational band as |ε-1| increases. Quite surprisingly, as this new band is separated from zero frequency by a gap, and lies below the onset frequency for translational vibrations, ω * , the presence of these new degrees of freedom leaves unaltered the basic scenario that the translational spectrum is determined only by the average contact number. Indeed, ω *  depends solely on coordination as it does for compressed packings of spheres. We also discuss the regime of large |ε-1|, where the two bands merge.},

    abstract = {We study the phase behaviour of hard oblate ellipsoids with superimposed short-ranged oblate-shaped square-well attractions using the replica exchange Monte Carlo method and a simple van der Waals type perturbation theory. By fixing the square-well range ([small lambda] = 0.25[sigma][dbl vertical bar]), we examine the effect of varying the oblates aspect ratio, k = [sigma][bottom]/[sigma][dbl vertical bar], on the density profiles, vapour-liquid and isotropic-nematic phase transitions. We observe that the formation of a liquid phase with vanishing density, an empty liquid, is possible with increasing aspect ratio. Surprisingly, the increasing shape anisotropy does not shift the stability region of the nematic phase to low densities, while the oblate-shaped square-well attraction favours disordered states. For k > 1.5, the critical temperature and packing fraction monotonically decrease with k, while the isotropic-nematic phase boundary moves towards higher packing fractions with decreasing temperature for all k. Simulations show that oblates preferably orientate their faces parallel to the vapour-liquid interface when located at the liquid side of the interface region and perpendicular when located at the vapour side.},

    abstract = {In dilute aqueous solution unimers of copolymer F127 ({E98P67E98}) associate to form micelles, and in more concentrated solution micelles pack to form high-modulus gels. Cosolvents are known to affect these processes, and ethanol/water mixtures have been of particular interest. Dynamic light scattering from dilute solutions was used to confirm micellization, but major attention was directed towards the gels. Visual observation of mobility (tube inversion) was used to detect gel formation, oscillatory rheometry to confirm gel formation and provide values of the elastic moduli over a wide temperature range, and small-angle X-ray scattering to determine gel structure. The solvents were limited to 10, 20 and 30 wt.\% ethanol/water. Critical concentrations for gel formation were similar for 10 and 20 wt.\% ethanol/water but were significantly increased for 30 wt.\% ethanol/water, e.g. at T = 45 °C from c ≈ 15 wt.\% to c ≈ 28 wt.\%. The elastic moduli reached maximum values at T ≈ 50 °C: e.g. G′ ≈ 25 {kPa} for 25 wt.\% F127 in 10 and 20 wt.\% ethanol/water and a similar value for 30 wt.\% F127 in 30 wt.\% ethanol/water. Hard gels of 30 and 35 wt.\% F127 in ethanol/water at 25 and 40 °C had the body-centered cubic (bcc) structure. The sol-gel boundary of the high-modulus (bcc) phase of F127 in water is essentially unchanged in 10 and 20 wt.\% ethanol/water, but is disrupted in 30 wt.\% ethanol water. \^{a}º Micellization, and gel diagram, modulus and structure of {F127/EtOH}/water were studied. \^{a}º Concentrations were over the range of particular interest to pharmaceutical chemists. \^{a}º Gel boundaries are similar for F127 in {0–20\%EtOH} but differ markedly for {30\%EtOH}. \^{a}º G′ of {30\%F127} in {30\%EtOH} is comparatively low.},

    abstract = {Colloidal particles in a water?lutidine ({WL}) binary liquid mixture experience temperature-dependent attraction close to the mixture?s demixing temperature. This temperature-tunable interaction can be potentially harnessed to assemble colloids and grow colloidal crystals. In this article, for the first time a novel attractive force gradient method is presented to fabricate high-quality, single-domain colloidal crystals. The well-controlled attractive force gradient here arises from a temperature gradient in the {WL} mixture. The nucleation of colloidal crystals in such a {WL} mixture preferably occurs in the high-temperature region because of the stronger attraction there. Crystallization propagates from the high-temperature region to the low-temperature region in a well-controlled way. The growth of the colloidal crystal is characterized in detail by Voronoi construction, the pair correlation function, and the orientational order parameter. It is found that the number of crystal-like particles increases with time, and a single-domain {2D} colloidal crystal can be produced. The mechanism of the defect-free crystallization process is discussed on the basis of an analogy to cluster beam deposition methods. This study demonstrates an efficient and robust way to prepare colloidal crystals with little to no defects, being suitable for applications such as colloidal lithography and the fabrication of perfect {3D} colloidal crystals.},

Different hydrolysis times at {pH} 4 were studied to establish the most optimal application conditions for bonding to the substrate. It was possible to observe how the bands corresponding to the {Si–O}–C groups present in the pure silane spectrum continued to appear after short periods of hydrolysis. However these bands practically disappeared upon increasing of this hydrolysis time, with other new ones appearing corresponding to the {Si–OH} vibration. The silanization of 6063 aluminum alloy samples was also carried out. Analysis of the silane layers by means of {FTIR} indicated that the immersion time may be important according to the hydrolysis conditions, and it also allowed optimizing the drying time.},

                Glasses are lucrative engineering materials owing to their superior mechanical properties such as high strength and large elastic strain. A central question concerns incipient plasticity - the onset of permanent deformation - that is central to their relaxation, aging, yield and fracture. Here, we use an analogue of nano-indentation performed on a colloidal glass to obtain direct images of the incipient plasticity, allowing us to elucidate the onset of permanent deformation. We visualize the microscopic strain by following distorted nearest neighbor configurations, and observe a surprising hierarchical structure of deformation: at the onset of irreversible deformation, the strain acquires a robust fractal structure, and we measure its fractal dimension. These results give direct evidence that the onset of permanent deformation has the hallmarks of a critical point, in agreement with recent theoretical works.

@article{Jiang2013Rheology,
    abstract = {We explore the rheology of high density glasses formed by binary colloidal mixtures in unentangled polyethylene glycol melts with a molecular weight of 400. A particle size ratio [small delta] = dl/ds = 4.8 is chosen to ensure that mixing results in a reduction in composite rheology without phase separation for a fixed high total volume fraction, [curly or open phi]c. We explore frequency dependent linear viscoelastic behaviors, yielding and shear-thickening behaviors, and study properties as a function of the volume fraction ratio of the large particles, R. We characterize the cross-over volume fractions which denote the onset of transient particle localization, [curly or open phi]x, and the maximum packing fractions, [curly or open phi]m, and find that both are non-monotonic functions of R, with [curly or open phi]m/[curly or open phi]x being a constant as R is varied from 0 to 1. Hard sphere scaling fails to capture the effects of particle size when R = 0 and R = 1, demonstrating that, even for these low molecular weight oligomers, polymer absorption and alterations of polymer configurations modify pair potentials away from being solely volume exclusion in nature. Changes in linear rheology, yielding behavior and shear-thickening are discussed in terms of a pseudo one-component model that depends on the dimensionless volume fraction [curly or open phi]* = ([curly or open phi]m - [curly or open phi]x)/([curly or open phi]m - [curly or open phi]c).},

@article{Zoldesi2007Encapsulation,
    abstract = {Surfactant-stabilized emulsion droplets were used as templates for the synthesis of hollow colloidal particles. Monodisperse silicone oil droplets were prepared by hydrolysis and polymerization of dimethyldiethoxysiloxane monomer, in the presence of surfactant: sodium dodecyl sulphate ({SDS}, anionic) or Triton X-100 (non-ionic). A sharp decrease in the average droplet radius with increasing surfactant concentration was found, with a linear dependence of the droplet radius on the logarithm of the surfactant concentration. The surfactant-stabilized oil droplets were then encapsulated with a solid shell using tetraethoxysilane, and hollow particles were obtained by exchange of the liquid core. The size and polydispersity of the oil droplets and the thickness of the shell were determined using static light scattering, and hollow particles were characterized by electron microscopy. Details on the composition of the shell material were obtained from energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. In the case of sodium dodecyl sulphate, the resulting shells were relatively thin and rough, while when Triton X-100 was used, smooth shells were obtained which could be varied in thickness from very thick (≈150 nm) to very thin shells (≈17 nm). Finally, hexane droplets were encapsulated using the same procedure, showing that our method can in principle be extended to a wide range of emulsions. Monodisperse, micrometer-sized hollow particles can be prepared by templating surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion droplets with silica/siloxane shells. },

    abstract = {Inside spaces of emulsion droplets can be used as mini-reactors for material synthesis. The novel application of sol?gel derived silicone oil droplets as mini-reactors was examined for the case of polymerization of styrene (St) and comonomers with the oil-soluble initiator 2,2?-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile). Polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS}) droplets prepared from dimethylsiloxane were used as the mini-reactors, in which the polymerization of St without comonomers was first conducted. In the polymerization, the {St/PDMS} volume ratio was varied from 0.025 to 0.10. After the polymerization, each {PDMS} droplet contained a polystyrene ({PSt}) particle. The {St/PDMS} ratio of 0.05 enabled the synthesis of micrometer-sized, spherical {PSt} particles with low polydispsersity. Copolymerization of St with comonomers having hydrophilic groups deformed the spherical shape of particles to lens-like or disk-like morphologies that were obtained with acrylic acid or sodium 4-styrene sulfonate, respectively. In another copolymerization, with divinylbenzene used as a cross-linker, hemispherical polymer particles were formed. To diversify the particle morphologies further, the proposed mini-reactor synthesis was combined with the recently proposed silicone oil droplet templating method (Ohta et al., 2012). Around the {PDMS} droplets containing a polymer particle, polymeric shells with a depression were successfully formed with the proposed method. The remaining {PDMS} oil inside the polymeric shells was extracted with ethanol, which caused hemispherical polymeric bowl-shaped capsules having a protrusion on the inside.},

The heaps, which are formed against the ridge, are characterized by two distinct phases: a solid-like bulk phase in the interior and a highly fluctuating, liquid-like state which exists along its leading edge. We observe that heaps only form above a critical flow velocity, vc, and that they are destroyed by thermal rearrangements when the flow ceases. We monitor the dynamics of heap formation using fluorescence video microscopy, measuring the heap volume and the angle of repose in response to microsphere deposition and erosion processes. We find that the steady state angle of repose, [small theta]f, increases as a function of inflow velocity, v[infinity], with a functional form .},

    abstract = {We demonstrate controlled growth of face-centered cubic ({FCC}), monodisperse hard-sphere colloidal crystals by centrifugation at up to 3000g onto {FCC} (100) templates. Such rapid deposition rates often result in an amorphous sediment. Surprisingly, however, growth onto (100) templates results only in single crystals with few or no extended defects. By contrast, deposition onto flat, (111), or (110) templates causes rapid disordering to an amorphous sediment if the dimensionless flux (particle volume fraction [times] Peclet number) exceeds a critical value. This crystalline-to-amorphous crossover results from the degeneracy of possible stacking positions for these orientations. No such degeneracy exists for growth onto (100). After growth, extended defects can nucleate and grow only if the crystal exceeds a critical thickness that depends on the lattice misfit with the template spacing. The experimental observations of the density of misfit dislocations are accounted for by the Frank-van der Merwe theory, adapted for the depth-dependent variation of lattice spacing and elastic constants that results from the gravitational pressure.},

@article{Tanaka2012Bond,
    abstract = {Abstract
                              There are at least three fundamental states of matter, depending upon temperature and pressure: gas, liquid, and solid (crystal). These states are separated by first-order phase transitions between them. In both gas and liquid phases a complete translational and rotational symmetry exist, whereas in a solid phase both symmetries are broken. In intermediate phases between liquid and solid, which include liquid crystal and plastic crystal phases, only one of the two symmetries is preserved. Among the fundamental states of matter, the liquid state is the most poorly understood. We argue that it is crucial for a better understanding of liquids to recognize that a liquid generally has the tendency to have a local structural order and its presence is intrinsic and universal to any liquid. Such structural ordering is a consequence of many-body correlations, more specifically, bond angle correlations, which we believe are crucial for the description of the liquid state. We show that this physical picture may naturally explain difficult unsolved problems associated with the liquid state, such as anomalies of water-type liquids (water, Si, Ge, ...), liquid-liquid transition, liquid-glass transition, crystallization and quasicrystal formation, in a unified manner. In other words, we need a new order parameter representing a low local free-energy configuration, which is a bond orientational order parameter in many cases, in addition to a density order parameter for the physical description of these phenomena. Here we review our two-order-parameter model of liquid and consider how transient local structural ordering is linked to all of the above-mentioned phenomena. The relationship between these phenomena is also discussed.

@article{PazminoBetancourt2013Fragility,
    abstract = {Polymer-nanoparticle composites play a vital role in ongoing materials development. The behavior of the glass transition of these materials is important for their processing and applications, and also represents a problem of fundamental physical interest. Changes of the polymer glass transition temperature Tg due to nanoparticles have been fairly well catalogued, but the breadth of the transition and how rapidly transport properties vary with temperature T - termed the fragility m of glass-formation - is comparatively poorly understood. In the present work, we calculate both Tg and m of a model polymer nanocomposite by molecular dynamics simulations. We systematically consider how Tg and m vary both for the material as a whole, as well as locally, for a range of nanoparticle ({NP}) concentrations and for representative attractive and repulsive {polymer-NP} interactions. We find large positive and negative changes in Tg and m that can be interpreted in terms of the {Adam-Gibbs} model of glass-formation, where the scale of the cooperative motion is identified with the scale of string-like cooperative motion. These results provide a molecular perspective of fragility changes due to the addition of {NPs} and for the physical origin of fragility more generally. We also contrast the behavior along isobaric and isochoric approaches to Tg, since these differing paths can be important to compare with experiments (isobaric) and simulations (very often isochoric). Our findings have practical implications for understanding the properties of nanocomposites and have fundamental significance for understanding the properties glass-forming materials more broadly.},

Here, in a second part to that review, we survey effects due to softness in the interparticle potential, which necessitates the use of an effective volume fraction. We review current experimental systems, and conclude that the one that most closely approximates hard spheres remains polymethylmethacrylate spheres sterically stabilised by polyhydroxystearic acid 'hairs'. For these particles their effective hard sphere diameter is around 1-10\% larger than the core diameter, depending on the particle size. We argue that for larger colloids suitable for confocal microscopy, the effect of electrostatic charge cannot be neglected, so that mapping to hard spheres must be treated with caution.},

@article{Lee2012Spontaneous,
    abstract = {Nature's particles, such as spores, viruses or cells, are adaptive—i.e., they can rapidly alter major phenomenological attributes such as shape, size, or curvature in response to environmental changes. Prominent examples include the hydration-mediated opening of ice plant seeds, actuation of pine cones, or the ingenious snapping mechanism of predatory Venus flytraps that rely on concave-to-convex reconfigurations. In contrast, experimental realization of reconfigurable synthetic microparticles has been extremely challenging and only very few examples have been reported so far. Here, we demonstrate a generic approach towards dynamically reconfigurable microparticles that explores unique anisotropic particle architectures, rather than direct synthesis of sophisticated materials such as shape-memory polymers. Solely enabled by their architecture, multicompartmental microcylinders made of conventional polymers underwent active reconfiguration including shape-shifting, reversible switching, or three-way toggling. Once microcylinders with appropriate multicompartmental architectures were prepared by electrohydrodynamic cojetting, simple exposure to an external stimulus, such as ultrasound or an appropriate solvent, gives rise to interfacial stresses that ultimately cause reversible topographical reconfiguration. The broad versatility of the electrohydrodynamic cojetting process with respect to materials selection and processing suggests strategies for a wide range of dynamically reconfigurable adaptive materials including those with prospective applications for sensors, reprogrammable microactuators, or targeted drug delivery.},

@article{Edmond2012Decoupling,
    abstract = {We use confocal microscopy to directly observe {3D} translational and rotational diffusion of tetrahedral clusters, which serve as tracers in colloidal supercooled fluids. We find that as the colloidal glass transition is approached, translational and rotational diffusion decouple from each other: Rotational diffusion remains inversely proportional to the growing viscosity whereas translational diffusion does not, decreasing by a much lesser extent. We quantify the rotational motion with two distinct methods, finding agreement between these methods, in contrast with recent simulation results. The decoupling coincides with the emergence of {non-Gaussian} displacement distributions for translation whereas rotational displacement distributions remain Gaussian. Ultimately, our work demonstrates that as the glass transition is approached, the sample can no longer be approximated as a continuum fluid when considering diffusion.},

    abstract = {Particle tracking is a key to single-particle-level confocal microscopy observation of colloidal suspensions, emulsions, and granular matter. The conventional tracking method has not been able to provide accurate information on the size of individual particles. Here we propose a novel method to localise spherical particles of arbitrarily relative sizes from either {2D} or {3D} (confocal) images either in a dilute or crowded environment. Moreover this method allows us to estimate the size of each particle reliably. We use this method to analyse local bond orientational ordering in a supercooled polydisperse colloidal suspension as well as the heterogeneous crystallisation induced by a substrate. For the former, we reveal non-trivial couplings of crystal-like bond orientational order and local icosahedral order with the spatial distribution of particle sizes: crystal-like order tends to form in regions where very small particles are depleted and the slightly smaller size of the central particle stabilizes icosahedral order. For the latter, on the other hand, we found that very small particles are expelled from crystals and accumulated on the growth front of crystals. We emphasize that such information has not been accessible by conventional tracking methods.},

@article{Kurita2012Measuring,

reality, many samples have a polydispersity of 4–10\%. At the level of an individual particle, 
the consequences of this polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual 
particle size from images of a dense sample. Here we propose a method to estimate individual 
particle radii from three-dimensional data of the particle positions. We first validate our method 
with simulations. We then apply our method to experimental data of colloidal suspensions 
observed with confocal microscopy. We demonstrate that we can recover the full particle size 
distribution in situ. Finally, we use our method to study the relationship between homogeneous 
colloidal crystal nucleation and particle sizes. We show that nucleation occurs in regions that 
are more monodisperse than average.},

@article{Kramb2011Reentrant,
    abstract = {We have designed and studied a new experimental colloidal system to probe how the weak shape anisotropy of uniaxial particles and variable repulsive (Coulombic) and attractive (van der Waals) forces influence slow dynamics, shear elasticity, and kinetic vitrification in dense suspensions. The introduction of shape anisotropy dramatically delays kinetic vitrification and reduces the shear elastic modulus of colloidal diatomics relative to their chemically identical spherical analogs. Tuning the interparticle interaction from repulsive, to nearly hard, to attractive by increasing suspension ionic strength reveals a nonmonotonic re-entrant dynamical phase behavior (glass–fluid–gel) and a rich variation of the shear modulus. The experimental results are quantitatively confronted with recent predictions of ideal mode coupling and activated barrier hopping theories of kinetic arrest and elasticity, and good agreement is generally found with a couple of exceptions. The systems created may have interesting materials science applications such as flowable ultrahigh volume fraction suspensions, or responsive fluids that can be reversibly switched between a flowing liquid and a solid nonequilibrium state based on in situ modification of suspension ionic strength.},

Polymers are polyethylene glycol 400 ({PEG400}), polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether 250 ({PEGDME250}), polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether 2000 ({PEGDME2000}), and polypropylene glycol 400 ({PPG400}), and the investigated electrolytes are {KCl}, {NH4Cl}, {MgCl2}, ({CH3}){4NCl}, {NaCl}, {NaNO3}, {Na2CO3}, {Na2SO4}, and {Na3Cit} (tri-sodium citrate). Aqueous solutions of {PPG400} form aqueous two-phase systems with all the investigated salts; however, other investigated polymers form aqueous two-phase systems only with {Na2CO3}, {Na2SO4}, and {Na3Cit}. A relation was found between the salting-out or sating-in effects of electrolyte on the polymer aqueous solutions and the slopes of the constant water activity lines of ternary polymer?salt aqueous solutions, so that, in the case of the salting-out effect, the constant water activity lines had a concave slope, but in the case of the salting-in effects, the constant water activity lines had a convex slope. The effect of temperature, anion of electrolyte, cation of electrolyte, and type and molar mass of polymers were studied and the results interpreted in terms of the solute?water and solute?solute interactions. The salting-out effect results from the formation of ion (specially anion)?water hydration complexes, which, in turn, decreases hydration, and hence, the solubility of the polymer and the salting-in effect results from a direct binding of the cations to the ether oxygens of the polymers.},

@article{Budwig1993Steady,
    abstract = {Steady flow in abdominal aortic aneurysm models has been examined for four aneurysm sizes over Reynolds numbers from 500 to 2600. The Reynolds number is based on entrance tube diameter, and the inlet condition is fully developed flow. Experimental and numerical methods have been used to determine: (i) the overall features of the flow, (ii) the stresses on the aneurysm walls in laminar flow, and (iii) the onset and characteristics of turbulent flow. The laminar flow field is characterized by a jet of fluid (passing directly through the aneurysm) surrounded by a recirculating vortex. The wall shear stress magnitude in the recirculation zone is about ten times less than in the entrance tube. Both wall shear stress and wall normal stress profiles exhibit large magnitude peaks near the reattachment point at the distal end of the aneurysm. The onset of turbulence in the model is intermittent for 2000 < Re < 2500. The results demonstrate that a slug of turbulence in the entrance tube grows much more rapidly in the aneurysm than in a corresponding length of uniform cross section pipe. When turbulence is present in the aneurysm the recirculation zone breaks down and the wall shear stress returns to a magnitude comparable to that in the entrance tube.},

@article{Phan1996Phase,
    abstract = {Despite an interparticle potential consisting of only an infinite repulsion at contact, the thermodynamics and dynamics of concentrated dispersions of hard spheres are not yet fully understood. Colloidal poly-(methyl methacrylate) spheres with a grafted layer of poly-(12-hydroxy stearic acid) ({PMMA}-{PHSA}) comprise a common model for investigating structural, dynamic, and rheological properties. These highly monodisperse spheres can be index matched in nonaqueous solvents, reducing van der Waals forces and allowing characterization via light scattering. In this work, we test the behavior of these dispersions against expectations for hard spheres through observations of the phase behavior, x-ray densitometry of equilibrium sediments, and Zimm viscometry. We set the effective hard sphere volume fraction by the disorder-order transition, thereby accounting for the polymer layer, any swelling due to the solvent, and polydispersity. The melting transition then occurs close to the expected value and the equation of state for the fluid phase, extracted from the equilibrium sediment with x-ray densitometry, conforms to the {Carnahan-Starling} equation. However, the osmotic pressure of the crystalline phase lies slightly above that calculated for a single fcc crystal even after accounting for polydispersity. Likewise the high shear viscosity of the fluid compares well with other hard sphere dispersions, but the low shear viscosity for {PMMA}-{PHSA} hard spheres exceeds those for polystyrene and silica hard spheres, e.g., a relative viscosity of 45±3 at φ=0.50 rather than 24. Our low shear viscosities are consistent with other {PMMA}-{PHSA} data after rescaling for both the polymer layer thickness and polydispersity, and may represent the true hard sphere curve. We anticipate that the equation of state for the crystal deviates due to polycrystallinity or a direct effect of polydispersity.},

Overall, the imposition of low shear rates radically transforms the relatively uniform quiescent structure into one marked by long-range heterogeneities and pronounced segregation of dense clusters and voids. Increasing the rate of deformation effects a consistent decrease in the average cluster size and a gradual transition towards a more homogeneous structure through the redistribution of voids. Interestingly, at high shear rates, the suspension microstructure for the large molecular weight polymer is nearly insensitive to the polymer concentration, and primarily determined by the shear rate alone. The prominent microstructural features of these shear-induced transformations are quantified in detail and discussed in light of the competition between interparticle attraction and microscopic shear forces.},

@article{Waitukaitis2012Impactactivated,
    abstract = {Although liquids typically flow around intruding objects, a
counterintuitive phenomenon occurs in dense suspensions of
micrometre-sized particles: they become liquid-like when perturbed
lightly, but harden when driven strongly1–5. Rheological
experiments have investigated how such thickening arises under
shear, and linked it to hydrodynamic interactions1,3 or granular
dilation2,4. However, neither of these mechanisms alone can explain
the ability of suspensions to generate very large, positive normal
stresses under impact. To illustrate the phenomenon, such stresses
can be large enough to allow a person to run across a suspension
without sinking, and far exceed the upper limit observed under
shear or extension2,4,6,7. Here we show that these stresses originate
from an impact-generated solidification front that transforms an
initially compressible particle matrix into a rapidly growing
jammed region, ultimately leading to extraordinary amounts of
momentum absorption. Using high-speed videography, embedded
force sensing and X-ray imaging, we capture the detailed dynamics
of this process as it decelerates a metal rod hitting a suspension of
cornflour (cornstarch) in water. We develop a model for the
dynamic solidification and its effect on the surrounding suspension
that reproduces the observed behaviour quantitatively. Our findings
suggest that prior interpretations of the impact resistance as
dominated by shear thickening need to be revisited.},

    abstract = {The non-equilibrium phase behavior of a colloidal hard-sphere fluid under oscillatory shear was investigated in real-space with experiments on poly(methyl methacrylate) ({PMMA}) colloidal suspensions and Brownian Dynamics computer simulations. All the samples in both experiments and the simulation are below the coexistence density of hard-sphere freezing, so the shear-induced crystals are out-of-equilibrium and melt after cessation of the shear. The physics is therefore fundamentally different from shear-induced crystallization in jammed or glassy systems. Although the computer simulations neglect hydrodynamic interactions and impose a linear flow, the results are in good agreement with the experiments. Depending on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation, four regimes with different structures, hereafter referred to as phases, were identified: an oscillating twinned face-centered-cubic (fcc) phase, a sliding layer phase, a string phase and a phase that has not been reported previously in experiments, which we identify as tilted layers. This phase consists of lanes of particles that order in a hexagonal-like array (in the gradient-vorticity plane) which has lines of particles under an angle with the horizontal. Phases similar to the sliding layers, string phase and tilted layer phase were reported in Brownian and Molecular Dynamics simulations (systematically called string formation) but the validity of these simulations has been questioned. We demonstrate the experimental existence of these string-like phases and elucidate their structural differences in real-space.},

The presence of probes may perturb the system, and such perturbations may or may not affect interpretation of host behavior from the probe observables typically measured. In this study, the manifestations of potential probe-induced changes to host dynamics in supercooled liquids are investigated via molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that probe dynamics do not necessarily mirror host dynamics as they exist either in the probe-free or probe-bearing systems. In particular, for a binary supercooled liquid, we find that smooth probes larger than the host particles induce increased translational diffusion in the host system; however, the diffusion is anisotropic and enhances caging of the probe, suppressing probe translational diffusion. This in turn may lead experiments that follow probe diffusion to suggest {Stokes-Einstein} behavior of the system even while both the probe-free and probe-bearing systems exhibit deviations from that behavior.},

@article{Solomon2010Microstructural,
    abstract = {We review the diverse range of materials made up of rod-shaped colloids. A common feature of such suspensions is the strong and efficient contribution of rods to the material's solid-like rheological properties such as elastic modulus and yield stress. Colloidal rod suspensions span from biomaterials such as f-actin and fd virus to inorganic materials such as boehmite and hematite, and to commercial fibers such as cellulose. We argue that, depending on the strength of pair potential interactions, such rod suspensions form microstructures that vary between the two limits of heterogeneous fractal clusters and homogeneous fiber networks. The volume fraction range for transition between these two limiting cases is strongly aspect ratio dependent. The two limiting microstructures can be distinguished by differences in the scattering vector dependence of their structure factors, as long as the range of scattering vector probed is sufficient to span regimes both above and below {qL} [approximate] 1. Here q is the scattering vector and L is the rod length. Theories of the Brownian dynamics of fractal clusters and fiber networks show that the two types of microstructure can lead to the arrested dynamics of gelation and the glass transition, respectively. The volume fraction and aspect ratio dependences of the dynamical slowing down of these two cases differ significantly; we suggest that probing these differences is a convenient way to distinguish between gels and glasses of colloidal rods. This distinction is important to clarify because these microstructures are determinants of rheological properties such as elasticity and yielding. By combining these structural and dynamical ideas about rods, we classify a set of literature measurements on more than fifteen different colloidal materials and thereby distinguish between regimes of gelation and vitrification. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research in the arrested dynamics, the non-linear rheology, and the absolute lower limit of gelation in colloidal rod suspensions.},

@article{Mukhija2011Nematic,
    abstract = {An applied field generated by centrifugation induced nematic order in colloidal rods of aspect ratio, r, varying from 3.6 to 8. The dependence of the order parameter, S, on dimensionless applied field strength was quantified by identifying the directors of the micron-sized poly(methyl methacrylate) rods in the suspension with confocal microscopy. The influence of the centrifugal field on orientational order was highly aspect ratio dependent. Order increased with field strength for r = 3.6, while it decreased with field strength for r = 8.0. All the measurements, however, were well correlated by [curly or open phi]/[curly or open phi]nem, where [curly or open phi]nem is the volume fraction of the nematic phase boundary. The most significant ordering of the rods, corresponding to S [approximate] 0.55 +/- 0.02, was measured at the highest achievable volume fractions of [curly or open phi]/[curly or open phi]nem [approximate] 1.35 +/- 0.09. At the largest centrifugal field strengths, the volume fraction for all three aspect ratios studied converged to [curly or open phi]/[curly or open phi]nem [approximate] 1.25 +/- 0.07. Comparison to previous theory and simulation of the isotropic-nematic transition of rod particles indicates that the field strengths required to generate nematic order were larger than would have been predicted under the assumption of local equilibrium in the sediments.},

@article{Peng2012Synthesis,
    abstract = {We describe a facile method to synthesize sterically stabilized monodisperse fluorescent poly(methyl methacrylate) ({PMMA}) colloids in the polar solvent mixture water/methanol with either a core?shell or a homogeneously cross-linked structure by dispersion polymerization. The particles were sterically stabilized by the polymer poly(vinylpyrrolidone) ({PVP}). The morphology of the particles was controlled by varying the moment at which the gradual addition of cross-linker and dye was started. The absence of these extra agents at a time when the particle nuclei formed reduced the negative effects on this important process to a minimum and produced a core?shell structure, whereas an essentially homogeneously cross-linked fluorescent polymer colloid structure could be obtained by reducing the starting time of the addition of dye and cross-linker to zero. Three different dyes were chemically incorporated into the polymer network. Such dyes are important for the use of the particles in confocal scanning laser microscopy studies aimed at characterizing concentrated dispersions quantitatively in real space. A series of {PMMA} particles with different sizes were obtained through the variation of the weight ratio of solvents and the content of cross-linker. Furthermore, the swelling properties of the cross-linked {PMMA} particles in a good solvent (tetrahydrofuran) were investigated. The particles were stable in polar solvents (water and formamide) but could also successfully be transferred to apolar solvents such as decahydronaphthalene (decalin). The {PVP} stabilizer also allowed the particles to be permanently bonded in flexible strings by the application of an external electric field.},

@article{Abate2006Approach,
    abstract = {Quasi-two-dimensional bidisperse amorphous systems of steel beads are fluidized by a uniform upflow of air, so that the beads roll on a horizontal plane. The short-time ballistic motion of the beads is stochastic, with {non-Gaussian} speed distributions and with different average kinetic energies for the two species. The approach to jamming is studied as a function of increasing bead area fraction and also as a function of decreasing air speed. The structure of the system is measured in terms of both the Voronoi tessellation and the pair distribution function. The dynamics of the system is measured in terms of both displacement statistics and the density of vibrational states. These quantities all exhibit tell-tale features as the dynamics become more constrained closer to jamming. In particular the pair distribution function and the Voronoi cell shape distribution function both develop split peaks. And the mean-squared displacement develops a plateau of subdiffusive motion separating ballistic and diffusive regimes. Though the system is driven and athermal, this behavior is remarkably reminiscent of that in dense colloidal suspensions and supercooled liquids. One possible difference is that kurtosis of the displacement distribution peaks at the beginning of the subdiffusive regime.},

Electrostatic interactions are screened by adding salt, so that the particles behave as hard spheres. By suspending the particles in an index-matching solvent (18\% urea in water) we have been able to investigate a wide range of particle volume fractions Φ from the dilute suspension up to 55\%. The partially crystalline internal structure of fluorinated polymer colloids gives rise to a significant depolarized component in the scattered light field. By studying the temporal fluctuations of the depolarized component we can evaluate the short-time self-translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of the particles over the whole colloidal fluid phase and within the hard-sphere colloidal crystal. We also analyze the full shape of the rotational correlation function, which deviates from an exponential behavior in concentrated suspensions. Starting from the generalized Smoluchowski equation, we calculate the Φ dependence of the rotational diffusion coefficient up to the Φ2 term, and we discuss the validity of the approximation that decouples translational from rotational motion. We find a good agreement between theoretical and experimental results.},

Although the magnitude of these fluctuations changes little with temperature, the sensitivity of molecular motion to changes in density and entropy increases strongly as the glass transition temperature (Tg) is approached from above. It is shown that density and entropy fluctuations can plausibly account for non-exponential relaxation processes and the enhancement of translational diffusion in deeply supercooled liquids. In particular, the entropy model correctly predicts that probe translation near Tg in o-terphenyl and polystyrene is more enhanced than in polyisobutylene.},

We review the main uses of single molecules in studies of condensed matter at nanometer scales, especially in the fields of soft matter and materials science. We discuss several examples, including the orientation distribution of molecules in crystals, rotational diffusion in glass-forming molecular liquids, polymer studies with probes and labeled chains, porous and heterogeneous oxide materials, blinking of single molecules and nanocrystals, and the potential of surface-enhanced Raman scattering for local chemical analysis. All these examples show that static and dynamic heterogeneities and the spread of molecular parameters are much larger than previously imagined.},

    abstract = {The translational diffusion of two small molecule probes, decacyclene and lophine, has been studied in supported polymer films as a function of film thickness using fluorescence nonradiative energy transfer. These probes are sufficiently large that their translational motion is coupled substantially to the segmental mobility of the polymer matrix. Probe diffusion in polystyrene films on fused quartz substrates was found to slow as film thickness is decreased below approximately 150 nm. In contrast, no change in probe diffusion as compared to bulk values was found in poly(isobutyl methacrylate) films as thin as 50 nm and poly(2-vinylpyridine) films as thin as 88 nm. These differences cannot be explained in terms of differences in polymer affinity for the fused quartz substrate, indicating that polymer?substrate affinity does not influence probe diffusion in this film thickness range. Probe diffusion toward polymer?substrate and polymer?free surface interfaces has also been studied with little change in diffusive behavior as compared to bulk in regions as close as 40 nm from the interface. This indicates that the range of influence of a particular polymer?free surface or polymer?substrate interaction is of limited extent (<40 nm distance) in modifying thin and ultrathin behavior.},

It is found that while the translational motion of an ellipsoid is isotropic at low density, it becomes increasingly anisotropic with density until the ratio of the parallel to the perpendicular diffusion coefficients becomes nearly equal to the value of the aspect ratio at high density. The latter is in agreement with the prediction of {Navier–Stokes} hydrodynamics with slip boundary condition. The product of the translational diffusion coefficient and the rotational correlation time also attains a hydrodynamic-like density independent behavior only at high density. The reorientational correlation function becomes nonexponential at high density and low temperature where it also develops a slow decay. The perpendicular component of the velocity time correlation function exhibits a clear double minimum, only at high density, which becomes more pronounced as the aspect ratio is increased. {\copyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

This system has a six-dimensional configuration space, but can be equivalently thought to explore a symmetric one-dimensional free-energy landscape containing two energy minima separated by an energy barrier. The exact free-energy landscape can be calculated as a function of system size by a direct enumeration of states. Results of simulations show the average time between cage breaking events follows an Arrhenius scaling when the energy barrier is large. We also discuss some of the consequences of using a one-dimensional representation to understand dynamics through a multidimensional space, such as diffusion acquiring spatial dependence and discontinuities in spatial derivatives of free energy.},

@article{Zhang2012Nonequilibrium,
    abstract = {Cluster formation and gelation are studied in a colloidal model system with competing short-range attractions and long-range repulsions. In contrast to predictions by equilibrium theory, the size of clusters spontaneously formed at low colloidal volume fractions decreases with increasing strength of the short-range attraction. Moreover, the microstructure and shape of the clusters sensitively depend on the strength of the short-range attraction: from compact and crystalline clusters at relatively weak attractions to disordered and quasi-linear clusters at strong attractions. By systematically varying attraction strength and colloidal volume fraction, we observe gelation at relatively high volume fraction. The structure of the gel depends on attraction strength: in systems with the lowest attraction strength, crowding of crystalline clusters leads to microcrystalline gels. In contrast, in systems with relatively strong attraction strength, percolation of quasi-linear clusters leads to low-density gels. In analyzing the results we show that nucleation and rearrangement processes play a key role in determining the properties of clusters and the mechanism of gelation. This study implies that by tuning the strength of short-range attractions, the growth mechanism as well as the structure of clusters can be controlled, and thereby the route to a gel state.},

The particles form dense layers along the walls, but crystallization is avoided as we use a mixture of two particle sizes. A normally liquidlike sample, when confined, exhibits slower diffusive motion. Particle rearrangements are spatially heterogeneous, and the shapes of the rearranging regions are strongly influenced by the layering. These rearranging regions become more planar upon confinement.

charged particles or particles labeled with complementary DNA sequences to form
the clusters, and we vary the ratio \$\alpha\$ of large to small sphere radii.
Near a critical size ratio \$\alpha\_c=(1+\sqrt{2})\$, we find that 90\% of the
clusters produced through random aggregation are tetrahedra containing four
large particles. A random sphere parking model shows that the high yield of
tetrahedra, which approaches 100\% in simulations at \$\alpha = \alpha\_c\$, arises
from the convergence of two geometrical bounds on the number of attached outer
spheres. We show that these bounds can be derived from the solutions to the
classic mathematical problems of spherical packing and covering. The phenomenon
we observe might be used to mass produce tetrahedral clusters, which can be
used as building blocks for isotropic optical metamaterials.},

    abstract = {Three-dimensional ordered lattices of nanoparticles ({NPs}) linked by {DNA} have potential applications in novel devices and materials, but most experimental attempts to form crystals result in amorphous packing. Here we use a coarse-grained computational model to address three factors that impact the stability of bcc and fcc crystals formed by {DNA}-linked {NPs} : (i) the number of attached strands to the {NP} surface, (ii) the size of the {NP} core, and (iii) the rigidity of the strand attachment. We find that allowing mobility in the attachment of {DNA} strands to the core {NP} can very slightly increase or decrease melting temperature {TM}. Larger changes to {TM} result from increasing the number of strands, which increases {TM}, or by increasing the core {NP} diameter, which decreases {TM}. Both results are consistent with experimental findings. Moreover, we show that the behavior of {TM} can be quantitatively described by the model introduced previously [F. Vargas Lara and F. W.

Here we aim to systematically study parameters that influence the relative thermodynamic and kinetic stability of such crystals. To avoid experimental bottlenecks and directly control molecular-scale parameters, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model in which short {DNA} strands (6 to 12 bp) are tethered to a {NP} core. We examine the influence of the number of bases per strand L, number of linking bases l and the number of spacer bases s on the stability of crystal states. We also consider the effect of using a single linking {NP} type versus a binary linking system. We explicitly compute the free energy, entropy, and melting point {TM} for {BCC} and {FCC} lattices. We show that binary systems are preferable for generating {BCC} lattices, while a single {NP} type generates the most stable {FCC} crystals. We propose a simple model for short {DNA} strands that can account for {TM} of all our data. The model also indicates that the heat of fusion between crystal and amorphous phases grows linearly with l, providing a route to maximize the relative crystal stability.},

We manipulate particles with dc-biased, ac electric fields and generate continuous-output streams of particles with a transverse outlet position specified by linear and nonlinear particle mobilities. We show, with simulation and experiment, that characteristic shape factors can be defined that capture the effects of constrictions in channel depth and that modulating the angle of these constrictions changes the resulting local {DEP} force. Microdevices are fabricated with an insulative constriction in channel depth, whose angle of incidence with the direction of flow varies continuously across the channel width. The resulting electric field gradients enable demonstration of a dielectrophoretic spectrometer that separates particles and controls their transverse channel position.},

Complex materials are separated into components to simplify measurement. Component properties measurable by {FFF} include mass, size, density, charge, diffusivity, and thickness of adsorbed layers. When characterization by these properties is inadequate, other measurement tools can be readily coupled to {FFF}, either off-line or on-line, by virtue of its flow-elution operation.

@article{Lindstrom2012Structures,
    abstract = {Sample-spanning networks of aggregated colloidal particles have a finite stiffness and deform elastically when subjected to a small shear stress. After some period of creep, these gels ultimately suffer catastrophic failure. This delayed yielding is governed by the association and dissociation dynamics of interparticle bonds and the strand structure of the gel. We derive a model which connects the kinetics of the colloids to the erosion of the strand structure and ultimately to macroscopic failure. Importantly, this model relates time-to-failure of the gel to an applied static stress. Model predictions are in quantitative agreement with experiments. It is predicted that the strand structure, characterized by its mesh size and strand coarseness, has a significant impact on delay time. Decreasing the mesh size or increasing the strand thickness makes colloidal gels more resilient to delayed yielding. The quench and flow history of gels modifies their microstructures. Our experiments show that a slow quenching increases the delay time due to the coarsening of the strands; by contrast, preshear reduces the delay time, which we explain by the increased mesh size as a result of shear-induced fracture of strands.},

By combining fast confocal microscopy with simultaneous force measurements, we systematically investigate a suspension's structure as it transitions through regimes of different flow signatures. Our measurements of the microscopic single-particle dynamics show that shear thinning results from the decreased relative contribution of entropic forces and that shear thickening arises from particle clustering induced by hydrodynamic lubrication forces.

One hypothesis for their origin is that they emerge from soft (Goldstone) modes associated with a broken continuous symmetry under time reparametrizations. To test this hypothesis, we use numerical simulation data to construct coarse grained observables and decompose their fluctuations into two transverse components associated with the postulated soft modes and a longitudinal component unrelated to them. We find that as temperature is lowered and time scales are increased, the time reparametrization fluctuations become increasingly dominant, and that their correlation volumes grow together with those of the dynamical heterogeneities, while the correlation volumes for longitudinal fluctuations remain small.},

    abstract = {We use confocal laser scanning microscopy to measure interactions in colloidal suspensions. By inverting the radial distribution function, determined by tracking the particle coordinates, we obtain the effective interaction between the colloidal particles. Although this method can be applied to arbitrary colloidal interactions, here we demonstrate its efficacy with two well-known systems for which accurate theories are available: a colloid-polymer mixture and binary hard spheres. The high sensitivity of this method allows for the precise determination of complex interactions, as exemplified, for example, by the accurate resolution of the oscillatory effective potential of the binary hard sphere system. We argue that the method is particularly well suited for the determination of attractive forces.},

@article{Yatsenko2007Ideal,
    abstract = {Our recent theory for the glassy dynamics of fluids and suspensions of hard nonspherical objects is applied to several modestly anisotropic shapes. The role of bond length and aspect ratio is studied for diatomics, triatomics, and spherocylinders. As spherical symmetry is broken the ideal kinetic glass transition volume fraction of all objects increases linearly with aspect ratio with the same slope, in surprising agreement with the jamming phase diagram of hard granular ellipsoids. The ideal glass boundary of all shapes is a nonmonotonic function of aspect ratio which is also in qualitative accord with the jamming behavior of spherocylinders and ellipsoids. The maximum glass volume fraction shifts to higher values, and larger aspect ratios, as the object becomes smoother. Suggestions for why the nonequilibrium jamming and kinetic ideal glass formation (dynamical crossover) boundaries are similar are advanced. Beyond the ideal glass volume fraction the nonequilibrium free energy acquires a localization well and entropic barrier. Although its form is highly nonuniversal, if different shapes are compared at constant barrier height then a good collapse is found. Collapse of the volume fraction dependence of the barrier height for different shapes is also predicted for modest shape anisotropy, but increasingly fails as the aspect ratio exceeds 2. For a given volume fraction the mean barrier hopping times are nonmonotonic functions of aspect ratio. The functional form of this dependence, and order of magnitude variation with aspect ratio, is distinct for each object.},

@article{Saltzman2006NonGaussian,
    abstract = {Brownian trajectory simulation methods are employed to fully establish the {non-Gaussian} fluctuation effects predicted by our nonlinear Langevin equation theory of single particle activated dynamics in glassy hard-sphere fluids. The consequences of stochastic mobility fluctuations associated with the space-time complexities of the transient localization and barrier hopping processes have been determined. The incoherent dynamic structure factor was computed for a range of wave vectors and becomes of an increasingly {non-Gaussian} form for volume fractions beyond the (naive) ideal mode coupling theory ({MCT}) transition. The {non-Gaussian} parameter ({NGP}) amplitude increases markedly with volume fraction and is well described by a power law in the maximum restoring force of the nonequilibrium free energy profile. The time scale associated with the {NGP} peak becomes much smaller than the relaxation time for systems characterized by significant entropic barriers. An alternate {non-Gaussian} parameter that probes the long time relaxation process displays a different shape, peak intensity, and time scale of its maximum. However, a strong correspondence between the classic and alternate {NGP} amplitudes is predicted which suggests a deep connection between the early and final stages of cage escape. Strong space-time decoupling emerges at high volume fractions as indicated by a nondiffusive wave vector dependence of the relaxation time and growth of the translation-relaxation decoupling parameter. Displacement distributions exhibit {non-Gaussian} behavior at intermediate times, evolving into a strongly bimodal form with slow and fast subpopulations at high volume fractions. Qualitative and semiquantitative comparisons of the theoretical results with colloid experiments, ideal {MCT}, and multiple simulation studies are presented.},

@article{Saltzman2008Largeamplitude,
    abstract = {Our microscopic stochastic nonlinear Langevin equation theory of activated dynamics has been employed to study the real-space van Hove function of dense hard sphere fluids and suspensions. At very short times, the van Hove function is a narrow Gaussian. At sufficiently high volume fractions, such that the entropic barrier to relaxation is greater than the thermal energy, its functional form evolves with time to include a rapidly decaying component at small displacements and a long-range exponential tail. The  ” jump” or decay length scale associated with the tail increases with time (or particle root-mean-square displacement) at fixed volume fraction, and with volume fraction at the mean α relaxation time. The jump length at the α relaxation time is predicted to be proportional to a measure of the decoupling of self-diffusion and structural relaxation. At long times corresponding to mean displacements of order a particle diameter, the volume fraction dependence of the decay length disappears. A good superposition of the exponential tail feature based on the jump length as a scaling variable is predicted at high volume fractions. Overall, the theoretical results are in good accord with recent simulations and experiments. The basic aspects of the theory are also compared with a classic jump model and a dynamically facilitated continuous time random-walk model. Decoupling of the time scales of different parts of the relaxation process predicted by the theory is qualitatively similar to facilitated dynamics models based on the concept of persistence and exchange times if the elementary event is assumed to be associated with transport on a length scale significantly smaller than the particle size.},

The latter fluid exhibits a region of dynamic anomalies in its phase diagram, where its mobility increases upon isochoric cooling, which is found to be a subset of a larger region of structural anomalies, in which its pair correlations strengthen upon isochoric heating. This  ” cascade of anomalies” qualitatively resembles that found in recent simulations of liquid water. The results for the hard-sphere and square-well systems also show that the breakdown of the {Stokes–Einstein} relation upon supercooling occurs for conditions where viscosity and self-diffusivity develop different couplings to the degree of pairwise structural ordering of the liquid. We discuss how these couplings reflect dynamic heterogeneities. Finally, we note that the simulation data suggest how repulsive and attractive glasses may generally be characterized by two distinct levels of short-range structural order.},

All properties are shown to be controlled by a single coupling constant determined by the fluid density and contact value of the radial distribution function. This parameter quantifies an effective mean square force exerted on a tagged particle due to collisions with its surroundings. The analysis suggests a conceptual basis for previous surprising findings of multiple inter-relationships between characteristics of the transient localized state, the early stages of cage escape, {non-Gaussian} or dynamic heterogeneity effects, and the barrier hopping process that defines the alpha relaxation event. The underlying physical picture is also relevant to fluids of nonspherical molecules and sticky colloidal suspensions. The possibility of a unified view of liquid dynamics is suggested spanning the range from dense gases to the zero mobility jammed state.},

We observe translational diffusion that is about 100 times faster at Tg + 3 K than the {Stokes?Einstein} prediction. Predictions from random first order transition theory and a dynamic facilitation approach are in reasonable agreement with our results; in these approaches, enhanced translational diffusion is associated with spatially heterogeneous dynamics. Self-diffusion controls crystallization in o-terphenyl for most of the supercooled liquid regime, but at temperatures below Tg + 10 K, the reported crystallization rate increases suddenly while the self-diffusion coefficient does not. This work and previous work on trisnaphthylbenzene both find a self-diffusion-controlled crystal growth regime and an enhancement in self-diffusion near Tg, suggesting that these phenomena are general characteristics of fragile low molecular weight glass formers. We discuss the width of the relaxation time distributions of o-terphenyl and trisnaphthylbenzene as they relate to the observation of enhanced translational diffusion.},

This method is analogous to the nucleation and growth of colloidal silica particles. The physical properties of the emulsions have been studied using dynamic light scattering and electrophoresis. Characterization of the {PDMS} phase has been undertaken principally by 29 Si and {1H} {NMR}, mass spectrometry, and {GPC}. The results show that in the absence of ethanol the cyclic tetramer octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) is the most prominent polymeric species. The ratio of linear to cyclic polymer in the {PDMS} phase may be altered by changing the amount of alcohol and/or monomer present in the initial reaction mixture. We also report the preparation of {aqueous/PDMS} emulsions by addition of water to an alcoholic solution of low molecular weight {PDMS}.},

@book{Jones2002Soft,
    abstract = {{The physics of soft condensed matter is probably one of the most 'fashionable' areas in the physical sciences today. This book offers a coherent and clear introduction to the properties and behaviour of soft matter. It begins with a treatment of the general underlying principles: the relation of the structure and dynamics of solids and liquids to intermolecular forces, the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transitions, and the principles of self-assembly. Then the specific properties of colloids, polymers, liquid crystals and self-assembling amphiphilic systems are treated within this framework. A concluding chapter illustrates how principles of soft matter physics can be used to understand properties of biological systems. The focus on the essentials and the straightforward approach make the book suitable for students with either a theoretical or an experimental bias. The level is appropriate for final year undergraduates and beginning graduate students in physics, chemistry, materials science, and chemical engineering.}},

@article{Bhattacharyya1997Decoupling,
    abstract = {Several experimental and computer simulation studies have found a partial decoupling between the diffusion coefficient of a small tagged particle from the viscosity of the medium in the supercooled liquid regime. In order to understand the microscopic origin of this decoupling, we have carried out detailed theoretical calculations of both quantities by using a self-consistent mode-coupling theory ({MCT}) which provides a microscopic treatment of coupled solute-solvent dynamics. We find that at low degree of supercooling, both the tracer diffusion coefficient (Dt) and the viscosity (η) of the medium vary similarly with a ratio close to the value given by the {Stokes–Einstein} relation (with the slip boundary condition). However, at higher supercooling the viscosity increases faster than the decrease in the diffusion coefficient. This decoupling is found to depend strongly on both the size of the solute and the degree of supercooling, in agreement with the recent experimental results. The decoupling starts at a lower degree of supercooling for smaller sized tracers. The physical origin of the decoupling can be traced back to the faster increase of viscosity due to the appearance of a long-time tail in the dynamic structure factor. While the appearance of the long-time tail leads to a rapid increase of viscosity, the friction on the tracer molecule, whose motion occurs on a shorter time scale and smaller length scale, increases slowly, thus leading to the partial decoupling. However, when the size of the solute is the same as that of the solvent molecules, the straightforward application of {MCT} fails to predict the observed decoupling. It is shown here that this decoupling could be explained semi-quantitatively by extending the mode-coupling theory to include solvent inhomogeneity. {\copyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

A single parameter, the volume fraction ([curly or open phi]), characterizes an ideal, monodisperse hard-sphere suspension. In comparing experiments with theories and simulation, researchers to date have paid little attention to likely uncertainties in experimentally-quoted [curly or open phi] values. We critically review the experimental measurement of [curly or open phi] in hard-sphere colloids, and show that while statistical uncertainties in comparing relative values of [curly or open phi] can be as low as 10-4, systematic errors of [greater, similar]3\% are probably unavoidable. The consequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing literature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion.},

We addressed this question by studying colloidal dynamics in a partially coated surface layer, using video microscopy. Particle mean squared displacement ({MSD}) functions were measured as a function of a (local) effective volume fraction ({EVF}), which was varied by making use of gravity settling. Comparison of {MSDs} at the bare and coated surfaces for {EVF} of 0.2?0.4 revealed that at the latter surface the motion amplitudes are strongly reduced, accompanied by a sharp transition from diffusive to nearly caged motion. This clearly indicates that the surface-attached particles cannot be taken into account via volume fraction and that their immobility has a distinct effect. For {EVF} > 0.45, the caging becomes dominated by the suspended particles, making the dynamics at the bare and coated surfaces similar.

@article{Berthier2011Theoretical,
    abstract = {A theoretical perspective is provided on the glass transition in molecular liquids at thermal equilibrium, on the spatially heterogeneous and aging dynamics of disordered materials, and on the rheology of soft glassy materials. We start with a broad introduction to the field and emphasize its connections with other subjects and its relevance. The important role played by computer simulations in studying and understanding the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is given. The recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics is reviewed. The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, an extensive overview is given of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.},

@article{Savin2007Statistical,
    abstract = {Video microscopy can be used to simultaneously track several microparticles embedded in a complex material. The trajectories are used to extract a sample of displacements at random locations in the material. From this sample, averaged quantities characterizing the dynamics of the probes are calculated to evaluate structural and/or mechanical properties of the assessed material. However, the sampling of measured displacements in heterogeneous systems is singular because the volume of observation with video microscopy is finite. By carefully characterizing the sampling design in the experimental output of the multiple particle tracking technique, we derive estimators for the mean and variance of the probes' dynamics that are independent of the peculiar statistical characteristics. We expose stringent tests of these estimators using simulated and experimental complex systems with a known heterogeneous structure. Up to a certain fundamental limitation, which we characterize through a material degree of sampling by the embedded probe tracking, these estimators can be applied to quantify the heterogeneity of a material, providing an original and intelligible kind of information on complex fluid properties. More generally, we show that the precise assessment of the statistics in the multiple particle tracking output sample of observations is essential in order to provide accurate unbiased measurements.},

We describe a class of fluorescent silica nanoparticles with a core-shell architecture and narrow particle size distribution, having a diameter of less than 20 nm and covalently incorporating a blue-emitting coumarin dye. A quantitative comparison of the scattering-corrected relative quantum yield of the particles to free dye in water yields an enhancement of approximately an order of magnitude. This enhancement of quantum efficiency is consistent with previous work on rhodamine dye-based particles. It provides support for the argument that improved brightness over free dye in aqueous solution is a more general effect of covalent incorporation of fluorescent organic dyes within rigid silica nanoparticle matrices. These results indicate a synthetic route towards highly fluorescent silica nanoparticles that produces excellent probes for imaging, security, and sensing applications.},

The incorporation of the thiol groups induced no drastic change in particle morphology in our reaction system, and the uniform spherical shape and the ordered hexagonal porous structure were simultaneously achieved when the molar ratio of {MPTMS} in the silica source was below 0.5. The inclusion of thiol groups into ordered nanoporous spheres was confirmed with {EDX} analysis, Raman spectroscopy, {29Si} {MAS} {NMR}, and sorption measurements. By using the thiol groups as the adsorption sites of a gold precursor, the thiol-functionalized spheres were converted into monodispersed gold-nanoparticle-embedded nanoporous spheres. The resultant spheres were readily self-assembled into a close-packed colloidal crystalline array, which exhibited an optical stop band corresponding to Bragg diffraction as well as a surface-plasmon-derived adsorption peak.

    abstract = {We report a facile method for systematic tuning of the hydrodynamic diameter of uniformed fluorescent silica particles in the size range from 12 to 465 nm. Dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy studies demonstrate that the hydrodynamic size distribution of the silica particles is uniform. We show that the initial amount of ethanol and ammonia are essential to tune the size of these particles. The hydrodynamic diameter of such a particle increases as the amount of ammonia is increased. An increase in the amount of ethanol leads to the formation of smaller particles. A higher initial amount of ethanol yields an increase in the concentration of ethoxide ions and a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide ions. Such control over the concentration of hydroxide ion, which is responsible for the formation of siloxane bonds, causes a controlled-growth of the silica particles, resulting in precise tuning of the hydrodynamic size. We confirm that a linear relationship exists between the size and brightness of particles, demonstrating that the amount of dye molecules in such particles can be regulated by the presented method. We prove that the silica network provides protection for dye molecules encapsulated in particles against solvents, fluorescence quenchers, and unfavorable {pH} of environments. Moreover, the fluorescent silica particles with the size of 12, 50, and 250 nm were found to not be cytotoxic against the epithelial cell lines of {MCF7} and {PC3}, even when the dosage levels up to 1.0 {mg/mL} and incubation periods up to 72 h were applied.},

Here we report on a novel synthesis of ultrabright fluorescent nanoporous silica discoids (a specific shape in-between the sphere and disk) of 3.1 +/- 0.7 microns in size, which were prepared using a stable inorganic sodium silicate silica source. Organic fluorescent dye Rhodamine {6G} ({R6G}) was physically (non-covalently) entrapped inside cylindrical nanochannels of [similar]4-5 nm in diameter. In contrast to the synthesis with organic silica precursors, the obtained particles showed an excessive leakage of dye. To prevent this leakage, we modified the synthesis by adding a small amount of a secondary silica source. The synthesized particles show virtually no leakage, high photostability, and a brightness equivalent to the fluorescence of up to 7 [times] 107 free {R6G} molecules. This is about 7 times higher than the fluorescent brightness of particles of the same size made of {CdSe}/{ZnS} quantum dots, and 420 times higher than the brightness of the same volume of aqueous solution of free {R6G} dye.},

@article{Wang2011Selfreplication,
    abstract = {{DNA} molecules provide what is probably the most iconic example of self-replication—the ability of a system to replicate, or make copies of, itself. In living cells the process is mediated by enzymes and occurs autonomously, with the number of replicas increasing exponentially over time without the need for external manipulation. Self-replication has also been implemented with synthetic systems, including {RNA} enzymes designed to undergo self-sustained exponential amplification1, 2, 3, 4, 5. An exciting next step would be to use self-replication in materials fabrication, which requires robust and general systems capable of copying and amplifying functional materials or structures. Here we report a first development in this direction, using {DNA} tile motifs that can recognize and bind complementary tiles in a pre-programmed fashion. We first design tile motifs so they form a seven-tile seed sequence; then use the seeds to instruct the formation of a first generation of complementary seven-tile daughter sequences; and finally use the daughters to instruct the formation of seven-tile granddaughter sequences that are identical to the initial seed sequences. Considering that {DNA} is a functional material that can organize itself and other molecules into useful structures6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, our findings raise the tantalizing prospect that we may one day be able to realize self-replicating materials with various patterns or useful functions.},

Many of these technological advancements are occurring on the nanometer scale, where multiple scientific disciplines are combining to create new materials with enhanced properties. The integration of inorganic synthetic methods with a size reduction to the nano-scale has lead to the creation of a new class of optical reporters, called quantum dots. These semiconductor quantum dot nanocrystals have emerged as an alternative to organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, and are brighter and more stable against photobleaching than standard fluorescent indicators. Quantum dots have tunable optical properties that have proved useful in a wide range of applications from multiplexed analysis such as {DNA} detection and cell sorting and tracking, to most recently demonstrating promise for in vivo imaging and diagnostics. This review provides an in-depth discussion of past, present, and future trends in quantum dot use with an emphasis on in vivo imaging and its related applications.},

However, there are two major problems that prevent broad use of the self-assembly process. First, the process brings too broad a variety of the assembled shapes. Secondly, the yield of the desired shapes is far from 100\%. Here, we describe a process of acidic self-assembly of silica shapes that is free of both of these problems. The process described results in virtually a 100\% of very uniform fibers. Each fiber has a hexagonal cross section of approximately 2 μm and a length of approximately 5 μm. The highly uniform pores with periodicity of 3.8 nm are unidirectional along the fiber. These new fibers can be used in chromatography, drug delivery, manufacturing nanowires, nanoreactors for "one-dimensional" chemistry, etc.},

The theoretical estimation of the colloidal interaction between monodispersed bare silica particles by using the {Derjaguin−Landau}−{Verwey−Overbeek} theory indicates that bare silica particles cannot be stabilized and they rapidly form aggregates in all the {ILs} used in this study. The instability of bare silica particles was experimentally confirmed by dynamic light scattering measurement and in situ transmission electron microscopy observations by utilizing the negligible vapor pressure of {ILs}. This evidence suggests that electrostatic stabilization is inefficient in {ILs} because of the high ionic atmosphere and the resulting surface-charge screening. The {PMMA}-grafted silica particles exhibited long-term colloidal stability in [{C4mim][PF6}] and [{Cnmim][NTf2}], which are compatible with the grafted {PMMA}. On the other hand, the {PMMA}-grafted particles could not be stabilized in [{C4mim][BF4}] due to the poor solubility of the grafted {PMMA} in the {IL}. Effective steric stabilization is important for obtaining stable colloidal particles in {ILs}.},

Meso(nano)porous silica particles, which are self-assembled in a sol-gel template synthesis, demonstrate an example of shapes of high complexity, similar to those observed in the biological world. Despite such complexity, here we present the evidence that at least a part of the formation of these shapes is an equilibrium process. We demonstrate it for an example of mesoporous fibers, one of the abundant shapes. We present a quantitative proof that the fiber free energy is described by the Boltzmann distribution, which is predicted by the equilibrium thermodynamics. This finding may open up new ground for a quantitative description of the morphogenesis of complex self-assembled shapes, including biological hierarchy.},

Fluorescent dye is physically entrapped inside nanochannels of a silica matrix created during templated sol–gel self-assembly. The problem of dye leakage from open channels is solved by incorporation of hydrophobic groups in the silica matrix. This makes the approach compatible with virtually any dye that can withstand the synthesis. The method is demonstrated using the dye Rhodamine {6G}. The obtained 40-nm silica particles are about 30 times brighter than 30-nm coated water-soluble quantum dots. The particles are substantially more photostable than the encapsulated organic dye itself.},

    abstract = {The synthesis of ultrabright fluorescent mesoporous silica nanoparticles ({UFSNPs}) of various sizes loaded with different amounts of fluorescent dye (Rhodamine {6G}) is reported here. The dye is physically entrapped inside the nanochannels of the silica matrix created during templated sol–gel self assembly. Due to the specific nanoenvironment, the fluorescence of the encapsulated dye molecules remains unquenched up to very high concentrations, which results in relatively high fluorescence. The particle size (ranging from 20–50 nm) and dye loading (0.8–9.3 mg dye per g particles) are controlled by the timing of the synthesis and the concentration of several organotriethoxysilanes, which are coprecursors of silica. The quantum yields of the encapsulated dye range from 0.65 to 1.0. The relative brightness of a single particle is equivalent to the fluorescence of 30–770 free nondimerized {R6G} dye molecules in water, or to that of 1.5–39 {CdSe}/{ZnS} quantum dots. Despite the presence of some hydrophobic groups on the particles' surfaces, colloidal suspensions of the particles are relatively stable (as monitored for 120 days).},

The blue shift in air is ascribed to a 1 nm shrinkage of the {CdSe} core by photooxidation. Photobleaching occurs about 4 times faster in air than in nitrogen, indicating the formation of nonradiative recombination centers during photooxidation. The initial light output is higher in air than in nitrogen, which may be due to a reduction of the defect state lifetime by oxygen.},

Many of these clusters are subsets of close-packed lattices. As the number of particles increases from 6 to 10, we observe the emergence of a complex free-energy landscape with a small number of ground states and many local minima.},

We find that the coupling between the translational ({τq*C}) and rotational (τ2) relaxation times increases with decreasing temperature T, whereas the coupling decreases between the translational (Dt) and rotational (Dr) diffusivities. In addition, the T dependence of Dt decouples from that of 1/τ2. We show that the decreasing coupling between Dt and Dr is only apparent due to the inadequacy of the concept of the rotational diffusion constant for describing the reorientational dynamics in the supercooled state. We also argue that the coupling between {τq*C} and τ2 and the decoupling between Dt and 1/τ2 can be consistently understood in terms of the growing dynamic length scale.},

@article{Cicerone1996Enhanced,
    abstract = {A holographicfluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique has been used to measure translational diffusion coefficients D T for four probes in supercooled o‐terphenyl ({OTP}). D T values from 10−6 to 10−14 cm2/s were observed in the temperature range from T g +8 K to T g +90 K (T g =243 K). In agreement with previous reports, the translational diffusion of probe molecules which are the same size as {OTP} molecules has a significantly weaker temperature dependence than T/η. However, as the size of the probe molecule is increased the temperature dependence of D T tracks T/η increasingly well. The transition between a weak temperature dependence to that of T/η occurs over only a factor of 3 in probe size. Previous work established that the rotational correlation times τ c of these four probes in {OTP} tracks {η/T}. The product D T τ c is independent of temperature for the largest probe but increases almost 2 orders of magnitude for the smaller probes as T g is approached. A strong correlation is observed between this enhancement of translational diffusion and the {KWW} β values obtained from rotation measurements; probes with small β values show enhanced translation. These observations are qualitatively explained by spatially heterogeneous dynamics. The probes studied are rubrene, 9,10‐bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene, tetracene, and anthracene.},

These fluctuations, known as blinking, limit the use of fluorophores in single-molecule experiments. The dark-state duration shows a universal heavy-tailed power-law distribution characterized by the occurrence of long non-emissive periods. Here we have synthesized novel {CdSe}–{CdS} core–shell quantum dots with thick crystalline shells, 68\% of which do not blink when observed individually at 33 Hz for 5 min. We have established a direct correlation between shell thickness and blinking occurrences. Importantly, the statistics of dark periods that appear at high acquisition rates (1 {kHz}) are not heavy tailed, in striking contrast with previous observations. Blinking statistics are thus not as universal as thought so far. We anticipate that our results will help to better understand the physico-chemistry of single-fluorophore emission and rationalize the design of other fluorophores that do not blink.},

    abstract = {We compare, using single-particle optical imaging, trajectories of rotation and translation for micron-sized spheres in index-matched colloidal suspensions near their glass transition. Rotational trajectories, while they show intermittent caged behavior associated with supercooled and glassy behavior, explore a sufficiently wider phase space such that in the averaged mean-square angular displacement there appears no plateau regime, but instead {sub-Fickian} angular diffusion that follows an apparent power law in time. We infer translation and rotation time constants, the former being the time to diffuse a particle diameter and the latter being the time to rotate a full revolution. Correlation between time constants increases with increasing volume fraction, but unlike the case for molecular glasses, the rotation time constant slows more weakly than the translation time.},

@article{Jose2006Complete,
    abstract = {The {Debye-Stokes}-Einstein ({DSE}) model of rotational diffusion predicts that the orientational correlation times τl vary as [l(l+1)]−1, where l is the rank of the orientational time correlation function (given in terms of the Legendre polynomial of rank l). One often finds significant deviation from this prediction, in either direction. In supercooled molecular liquids where the ratio τ1∕τ2 falls considerably below 3 (the Debye limit), one usually invokes a jump diffusion model to explain the approach of the ratio τ1∕τ2 to unity. Here we show in a computer simulation study of a standard model system for thermotropic liquid crystals that this ratio becomes much less than unity as the isotropic-nematic phase boundary is approached from the isotropic side. Simultaneously, the ratio τ2∕η, η being the shear viscosity of the liquid, becomes much larger than the hydrodynamic value near the {I-N} transition. We also analyze the breakdown of the Debye model of rotational diffusion in ratios of higher order orientational correlation times. We show that the breakdown of the {DSE} model is due to the growth of orientational pair correlation and provide a mode coupling theory analysis to explain the results.},

@article{Zaman1998Rheology,
    abstract = {The shear viscosity of electrostatically stabilized bidisperse aqueous silica suspensions has been studied as a function of shear rate, particle size, total volume fraction of the particles, and volume ratio of small to large particles. The higher limiting relative viscosity at 1000 s1 of monodisperse suspensions of 0.6, 0.85, and 1.5 m silica particles was found to be particle size dependent indicating deviation from hard sphere behavior. It is shown that the flow properties of bidisperse suspensions of colloidal size particles is not only affected by the volume weight ratio of the two sizes, but the absolute size of the particles and the particle size ratio also play an important role in determining the viscosity of the suspension. Binary mixtures of particles of smaller size ratios show higher viscosities than the suspensions containing larger size ratio particles. This indicates that the viscosity response of suspensions of colloidal size particles is controlled by both hydrodynamic interactions and colloidal forces. The Farris Trans. Soc. Rheol. 12, 281 1968 model was found to be inadequate when applied to bidisperse suspension of colloidal size particles. An empirical method is suggested to estimate the viscosity of a bimodal suspension at a given volume fraction of the particles, from the viscosity of monodisperse systems and the viscosity of a bimodal suspension at a fixed total volume fraction as a function of the volume ratio of the two particles.},

@article{Pickrahn2010Relationship,
    abstract = {{PMID}: 19831349 We investigate the link between the microstructure, dynamics, and rheological properties in dense (ϕ = 0.3) mixtures of charge-stabilized colloidal silica and oppositely charged poly(ethylene imine) polymer in a mixed {DMSO}/{H2O} solvent. Over a finite range of polymer concentrations, the addition of polymer results in the formation of sample-spanning, self-supporting gel networks. As the polymer concentration is increased, a reentrant rheological transition is observed where the gel's elastic modulus and yield stress initially increase and subsequently drop. The dynamic and microstructural changes associated with this transition are resolved using quantitative confocal microscopy. Within the initial regime, a biphasic system consisting of a mixture of arrested and diffusive particles is observed. We segregate the particles with high accuracy into mobile and arrested populations based on their dynamics. The addition of polymer in this regime systematically decreases the proportion of free particles, until all the particles are arrested. Concurrent with this transition, the elastic modulus and yield stress go through their corresponding maxima. However, over the range of polymer concentrations studied, the reentrant transition to weak gels is not captured by the particle dynamics but is instead accompanied by subtle changes in the microstructure of the arrested phase. We discuss two possible scenarios for this behavior in view of the strength of interparticle bonds.},

In the center of the cavity, Dα turned out to be {0.75D0} measured in bulk liquid. On approaching the cylindrical wall, a transition region of about 3 particle diameters wide was found in which the radial and azimuthal components of Dα decrease to respective values of {0.1D0} and {0.4D0}, indicating asymmetrical diffusion. Hydrodynamic simulations of local drag coefficients for hard spheres produced very good agreement with experimental results.

The rotational, {DR}, and center-of-mass translational, {DCM}, diffusion constants are calculated for a wide range of rod length L and density of obstacles ρ. It is found that {DCM} follows the behavior predicted by kinetic theory for a hard disk with an effective radius {R(L}). A dynamic crossover is observed in {DR} for L comparable to the typical distance between neighboring obstacles dnn. Using arguments from kinetic theory and reptation, we rationalize the scaling laws, dynamic exponents, and prefactors observed for {DR}. In analogy with the enhanced translational diffusion observed in deeply supercooled liquids, the {Stokes-Einstein}-Debye relation is violated for L > 0.6dnn.},

@article{Corezzi1999Dynamics,
    abstract = {Dielectric measurements of an epoxy resin, N, N-diglycidyl-4-glycidyloxyaniline, have been carried out in the supercooled and glassy phase over a broad frequency range (102-6 ×109 Hz). The measurements reveal electrical transport due to ionic impurities as well as three different dipolar relaxations - in addition to the alpha- and beta-relaxation, a slower alpha´-relaxation is recognized, whose loss peak is disclosed after subtraction of the dc conductivity contribution. The glass transition is found to affect markedly the secondary relaxation, whose strength and shape parameters change across Tg. The major inference from the results concerns the existence of a transition in the dynamics, occurring some tens of degrees above Tg, in the vicinity of the temperature {TS} where the peaks of the alpha- and beta-relaxations merge. Evidence in favour of such a transition is given by: (i) the change in the temperature dependence of the alpha-relaxation time; (ii) independently, the change in the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity; (iii) the breakdown of the {Debye-Stokes}-Einstein model, replaced at lower temperatures by a fractional regime. Concerning the alpha´-process, it shows a {Vogel-Fulcher} behaviour with the same temperature T0 as the alpha-relaxation but, unlike this last, it is not involved in a splitting phenomenon with the beta-relaxation. Several hypotheses concerning the nature of the alpha´-process are explored.},

Over a large temperature interval a simple power law relates diffusion and viscosity, whereas at lower temperatures the decoupling is stronger and an activated dynamics is observed. These experiments are discussed together with previous data concerning other tracer/glass former couples.

Mobile and immobile ions within 500.0 ps time windows were identified, and short-range spatial correlations between them were analysed. Mobile ions are strongly correlated, but they are much less correlated with immobile ones. In the case of the {NO3}– species, the sub-ensemble of translationally mobile ions also results in a rapidly decaying reorientational correlation function. Thus, if one probes spatial heterogeneity of rotational degrees of freedom in {CKN}, one will be also probing spatial heterogeneity of translational degrees of freedom, and vice-versa. By using a reorientation analogous of the van Hove correlation function, small angle rotational diffusion in the dynamics of mobile anions, and large angular jumps in the dynamics of immobile ones were observed.},

During the growth of ordered domains from small to large scales, the molecule-molecule interactions were found to overrule the coupling to the substrate, causing a reorientation of the monolayer. The flexibility at the molecular level, due to reversible hydrogen bonds, was directly visualized by {STM}. The supramolecules were able to slide and insert between neighboring molecules, allowing the annihilation of domain boundaries and improving long range order. Large domains were found to cross monoatomic steps on the substrate without perturbation of their order.},

Polystyrene {MW} is shown to have no significant impact on the film thickness dependence of Tg ? Tg,bulk. In contrast, a small modification to the repeat unit structure of {PS} has a dramatic impact on the Tg-nanoconfinement effect. The strength of the thickness dependence of Tg is greater for poly(4-methylstyrene) ({P4MS}) than for {PS} and yet much greater for poly(4-tert-butylstyrene) ({PTBS}). The Tg reduction for {PTBS} is 47 K below Tg,bulk for a 25 nm thick film, with the onset thickness for confinement effects in {PTBS} being 300?400 nm. Measurements of the size of cooperatively rearranging regions, ?{CRR}, in bulk polymer systems at Tg reveal that {PS} {MW} has no significant effect on ?{CRR} unless {PS} is oligomeric or nearly oligomeric. However, changes to repeat unit structure and diluent addition affect ?{CRR} values, but not in a manner that yields an obvious correlation with the Tg-nanoconfinement effect.},

matter systems. Assuming a familiarity with the basics of quantum mechanics
and statistical mechanics, the book establishes a general framework for
describing condensed phases of matter based on symmetries and conservation
laws. After surveying the structure and properties of materials with different
symmetries, it explores the role of spatial dimensionality and microscopic
interactions in determining the nature of phase transitions. Particular
attention is given to critical phenomena and renormalization group methods.
The properties of liquids, liquid crystals, quasicrystals, crystalline solids,
magnetically ordered systems and amorphous solids are investigated in terms of
their symmetry, generalized rigidity, hydrodynamics and topological defect
structure. In addition to serving as a course text, this book is an essential
reference for students and researchers in physics, applied physics, chemistry,
materials science and engineering, who are interested in modern condensed

@article{Caputo2003Cumulative,
    abstract = {The effects of amino acid substitutions upon the behavior of {poly(Leu})-rich alpha-helices inserted into model membrane vesicles were investigated. One or two consecutive Leu residues in the hydrophobic core of the helix were substituted with A, F, G, S, D, K, H, P, {GG}, {SS}, {PG}, {PP}, {KK}, or {DD} residues. A Trp placed at the center of the sequence allowed assessment of peptide behavior via fluorescence emission lambda(max) and dual quenching analysis of Trp depth [Caputo, G. A., and London, E. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 3265-3274]. In vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ({DOPC}), all of the peptides with single substitutions adopted a transmembrane ({TM}) state. Experiments were also performed in thicker bilayers composed of dierucoylphosphatidylcholine ({DEuPC}). In {DEuPC} vesicles {TM} states were destabilized by mismatch between helix length and bilayer thickness. Nevertheless, in {DEuPC} vesicles {TM} states were still prevalent for peptides with single substitutions, although less so for peptides with P, K, H, or D substitutions. In contrast to single substitutions, certain consecutive double substitutions strongly interfered with formation of {TM} states. In both {DOPC} and {DEuPC} vesicles {DD} and {KK} substitutions abolished the normal {TM} state, but {GG} and {SS} substitutions had little effect. In even wider bilayers, a {SS} substitution reduced the formation of a {TM} state. A peptide with a {PP} substitution maintained the {TM} state in {DOPC} vesicles, but in {DEuPC} vesicles the level of formation of the {TM} state was significantly reduced. Upon disruption of normal {TM} insertion peptides moved close to the bilayer surface, with the exception of the {KK}-substituted peptide in {DOPC} vesicles, which formed a truncated {TM} segment. These studies begin to provide a detailed relationship between sequence and the stability of {TM} insertion and show that the influence of insertion-destabilizing residues upon hydrophobic helices can be strongly modulated by properties such as mismatch. For certain helix-forming hydrophobic sequences, sensitivity to lipid structure may be sufficient to induce large conformational changes in vivo.},

After a brief review of colloidal imaging, we describe various flow geometries for two and three-dimensional ({3D}) imaging, including a 'confocal rheoscope'. This latter combination of a confocal microscope and a rheometer permits simultaneous characterization of rheological response and {3D} microstructural imaging. The main part of the paper discusses in detail how to identify and track particles from confocal images taken during flow. After analyzing the performance of the most commonly used colloid tracking algorithm by Crocker and Grier extended to flowing systems, we propose two new algorithms for reliable particle tracking in non-uniform flows to the level of accuracy already available for quiescent systems. We illustrate the methods by applying it to data collected from colloidal flows in three different geometries (channel flow, parallel plate shear and cone plate rheometry).},

Above a particle-size dependent limit 0, direct microscopic observations demonstrate jamming and unjamming—conversion of fluid to solid and vice versa—during flow. We show that such a jamming flow produces a reduction in colloid concentration x downstream of the constriction. We propose that this "self-filtration" effect is due to a combination of jamming of the particulate part of the system and continuing flow of the liquid part, i.e., the solvent, through the pores of the jammed solid. Thus we link jamming in colloidal and granular media with a "two-fluid-like" picture of the flow of concentrated suspensions. Results are also discussed in the light of the original experiments of Reynolds on dilation in granular materials.},

@article{Narumi2011Spatial,
    abstract = {We study concentrated binary colloidal suspensions, a model system which has a glass transition as the volume fraction [small phi] of particles is increased. We use confocal microscopy to directly observe particle motion within dense samples with [small phi] ranging from 0.4 to 0.7. Our binary mixtures have a particle diameter ratio {dS}/{dL} = 1/1.3 and particle number ratio {NS}/{NL} = 1.56, which are chosen to inhibit crystallization and enable long-time observations. Near the glass transition we find that particle dynamics are heterogeneous in both space and time. The most mobile particles occur in spatially localized groups. The length scales characterizing these mobile regions grow slightly as the glass transition is approached, with the largest length scales seen being [similar] 4 small particle diameters. We also study temporal fluctuations using the dynamic susceptibility [small chi]4, and find that the fluctuations grow as the glass transition is approached. Analysis of both spatial and temporal dynamical heterogeneity show that the smaller species play an important role in facilitating particle rearrangements. The glass transition in our sample occurs at [small phi]g[approximate] 0.58, with characteristic signs of aging observed for all samples with [small phi] > [small phi]g.},

@article{Sharp2003Free,
    abstract = {The effect of free surfaces on the glass transition temperature (Tg) of thin polystyrene films was studied. Measurements were performed on films (8   nm<h<290   nm) with one free surface and on films capped with a 5 nm thick metal layer (no free surfaces). Potential problems with evaporative deposition were eliminated by studying samples made of two supported films placed with their free surfaces in contact and annealed. Uncapped films displayed reduced Tg values for h≲40   nm while all  ” properly” capped films exhibited a Tg value the same as that of the bulk polymer (370±1  K). When the free surface was restored, the measured Tg values the same as those of uncapped films of the same thickness. These results show that free surfaces are crucial for observing Tg reductions in thin polymer films and address the role of the sample preparation history.},

Partial-density-fluctuation correlation functions for the two species are reported. Results for the -relaxation process are quantified by parameters for the strength, stretching, and time scale, where the latter varies over almost four orders of magnitude upon compression. The parameters exhibit an appreciable dependence on the wave vector, and this dependence is different for the correlation function referring to the smaller and that for the larger species. These features are shown to be in semiquantitative agreement with those calculated within the mode-coupling theory for ideal liquid-glass transitions.},

@article{Jackson1991Glass,
    abstract = {The glass-transition temperatures, Tg, of organic liquids confined to small pores were studied by differential scanning calorimetry ({DSC}). The Tg was measured as a function of pore size in controlled pore glasses ({CPG}) having pore diameters in the range of 40–730 \AA{}. The surface of the glass was treated with hexamethyldisilazane to promote wetting by the organic liquids studied (o-terphenyl and benzyl alcohol). Glasses formed in the pores had a lower Tg than in the bulk and the reduction in Tg increased as the pore size decreased. For example, the depression of the glass transition temperature, {ΔTg}, of benzyl alcohol in 40 \AA{} and 85 \AA{} pores was 7.2 K and 3.1 K, respectively. The magnitude of {ΔTg} also depends on the material; e.g. for o-terphenyl in the 85 \AA{} pores, {ΔTg} was 8.8 K versus 3.1 K for benzyl alcohol. In general, it was noted that {ΔTg} was considerably less than for the depression of the crystalline melting point, {ΔTm}, studied in related work. For example, for benzyl alcohol in the 85 \AA{} pores, {ΔTm} was ∼ 25 K and {ΔTg} was ∼ 3 K.},

    abstract = {We have measured equilibrium sedimentation profiles in a colloidal model system with confocal microscopy. By tuning the interactions, we have determined the gravitational length in the limit of hard-sphere-like interactions, and using the same particles tested a recent theory (van Roij 2003  J. Phys.: Condens. Matter   15  S3569), which predicts a significantly extended sedimentation profile in the case of charged colloids with long-ranged repulsions, due to a spontaneously formed macroscopic electric field. For the hard-sphere-like system we find the gravitational length matches that expected. By tuning the buoyancy of the colloidal particles we have shown that a mean field hydrostatic equilibrium description even appears to hold in the case where the colloid volume fraction changes significantly on the length scale of the particle size. The extended sedimentation profiles of the colloids with long-ranged repulsions are well described by theory. Surprisingly, the theory even seems to hold at concentrations where interactions between the colloids, which are not modelled explicitly, play a considerable role.},

@article{Watanabe2011Structural,
    abstract = {Spatial confinement is known to induce a drastic change in the viscosity, relaxation times, and flow profile of liquids near the glass (or jamming) transition point. The essential underlying question is how a wall affects the dynamics of densely packed systems. Here we study this fundamental problem, using experiments on a driven granular hard-sphere liquid and numerical simulations of polydisperse and bidisperse colloidal liquids. The nearly hard-core nature of the particle–wall interaction provides an ideal opportunity to study purely geometrical confinement effects. We reveal that the slower dynamics near a wall is induced by wall-induced enhancement of 'glassy structural order', which is a manifestation of strong interparticle correlations. By generalizing the structure-dynamics relation for bulk systems, we find a quantitative relation between the structural relaxation time at a certain distance from a wall and the correlation length of glassy structural order there. Our finding suggests that glassy structural ordering may be the origin of the slow glassy dynamics of a supercooled liquid.},

@article{Zhu1997Crystallization,
    abstract = {The structure of, and transitions between, liquids, crystals and glasses have commonly been studied with the hard-sphere model1, 2, 3, 4, 5, in which the atoms are modelled as spheres that interact only through an infinite repulsion on contact. Suspensions of uniform colloidal polymer particles are good approximations to hard spheres6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and so provide an experimental model system for investigating hard-sphere phases. They display a crystallization transition driven by entropy alone. Because the particles are much larger than atoms, and the crystals are weakly bound, gravity plays a significant role in the formation and structure of these colloidal crystals. Here we report the results of microgravity experiments performed on the Space Shuttle Columbia to elucidate the effects of gravity on colloidal crystallization. Whereas in normal gravity colloidal crystals grown just above the volume fraction at melting show a mixture of random stacking of hexagonally close-packed planes (r.h.c.p.) and face-centred cubic (f.c.c.) packing if allowed time to settle7,8, those in microgravity exhibit the r.h.c.p. structure alone, suggesting that the f.c.c. component may be induced by gravity-induced stresses. We also see dendritic growth instabilities that are not evident in normal gravity, presumably because they are disrupted by shear-induced stresses as the crystals settle under gravity. Finally, glassy samples at high volume fraction which fail to crystallize after more than a year on Earth crystallize fully in less than two weeks in microgravity. Clearly gravity masks or alters some of the intrinsic aspects of colloidal crystallization.},

In concentrated dispersions it was used to determine the structure factor. The latter was compared with that expected for an interacting system of hard spheres and reasonable agreement obtained.

@article{Ngai1999Alternative,
    abstract = {We offer an alternative explanation of the breakdown of {DebyeStokesEinstein} and {StokesEinstein} relations observed as enhanced translational diffusion compared with rotational diffusion of probe molecules in supercooled liquids and polymers close to the glass transition temperature. By showing that the breakdowns of {DebyeStokesEinstein} and {StokesEinstein} relations in glass-forming liquids are special cases of a more general phenomenon, it becomes clear that a more general explanation than spatially heterogeneous dynamics is needed. In the framework of the coupling model, the explanation is based on the fact that different dynamic variables mu weigh the intermolecular cooperativity differently and have different coupling parameters (i.e., degrees of intermolecular cooperativity), nmu, which enter into the stretch exponents of their correlation functions, mu(0)mu(t) = exp[(t/taumu)1-nmu], represented in the Kohlrausch form. In some of the applications we made, the values of nmu's are known from experiment and the difference between them is absolutely clear. The explanation of the difference between the taumu's and their temperature dependencies then becomes quantitative, requiring no adjustable parameter (Ngai, K. L.; Mashimo, S.; Fytas, G. Macromolecules 1988, 21, 3030). An exception is the present explanation of the breakdown of {StokesEinstein} relation where experimental technique has not yet been developed to determine the microscopic correlation function and, hence, the coupling parameter of translational diffusion. The explanation from the coupling model is based on the assumption that the known coupling parameter of rotational diffusion is larger than that of translational diffusion, which has been justified on theoretical grounds and can be falsified experimentally when the latter becomes known in the future. The effect depends on the degree of probe participation in the cooperative dynamics with the host molecules characterized by the ratio, tauc/taualpha, of the probe rotational relaxation time tauc to the alpha-relaxation time of the neat host taualpha. The observed variation in the magnitude of the enhanced translation with the size of the probes in supercooled liquids and polymers is explained. In the process, we have established a correlation between the enhanced translation and tauc/taualpha as well as a correlation between the Kohlrausch exponent beta of the rotation correlation function and tauc/taualpha. These two correlations when combined give rise to the correlation between enhanced translational diffusion and (1-beta) established earlier by Ediger and co-workers. The present explanation of enhanced translational diffusion can also explain the recent findings of (a) a parallel enhancement of dielectric relaxation in supercooled liquids by Chang and Sillescu and (b) a breakdown of the {DebyeStokesEinstein} relation of deploarized light scattering data of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A by Comez et al. On the other hand, the spatially heterogeneous dynamics explanation of enhanced translation no longer can explain these results.},

@article{VidalRussell2000Direct,
    abstract = {The increasingly sluggish response of a supercooled liquid as it nears its glass transition1 (for example, refrigerated honey) is prototypical of glassy dynamics found in proteins, neural networks and superconductors. The notion that molecules rearrange cooperatively has long been postulated2 to explain diverging relaxation times and broadened (non-exponential) response functions near the glass transition. Recently, cooperativity was observed and analysed in colloid glasses3 and in simulations of binary liquids well above the glass transition4. But nanometre-scale studies of cooperativity at the molecular glass transition are lacking5. Important issues to be resolved include the precise form of the cooperativity and its length scale6, and whether the broadened response is intrinsic to individual cooperative regions, or arises only from heterogeneity7, 8, 9 in an ensemble of such regions. Here we describe direct observations of molecular cooperativity near the glass transition in polyvinylacetate ({PVAc}), using nanometre-scale probing of dielectric fluctuations. Molecular clusters switched spontaneously among two to four distinct configurations, producing random telegraph noise. Our analysis of these noise signals and their power spectra reveals that individual clusters exhibit transient dynamical heterogeneity and non-exponential kinetics.},

@article{vanMegen1993Dynamiclightscattering,
    abstract = {Dynamic light scattering is applied to the glass phase of nonaqueous suspensions of sterically stabilized colloidal spheres. The short-ranged steric repulsion ensures that the particle interactions are close to hard sphere. This is supported by the observation that the equilibrium phase behavior of these suspensions agrees with that predicted for the hard-sphere atomic system. We verify a model for a nonergodic medium, which assumes that the particles are localized during an experiment and which allows the intermediate scattering function to be calculated from a single measurement of the time-averaged intensity autocorrelation function. Intermediate scattering functions are obtained for several concentrations over a range of wave vectors around the main diffraction peak. The measured nonergodicity parameters are in good agreement with the predictions of mode-coupling theory for the hard-sphere glass. The comparison involves no adjustable parameters. At long times the intermediate scattering functions can be scaled to a single curve for over 2.5 decades in time. This, combined with the results that the nonergodicity parameters and critical amplitudes required for the scaling are in quantitative agreement with mode-coupling theory, provides a convincing verification of the predicted factorization property of the β process in the glass phase.},

The observed phase behavior, fluid, crystal, and glass, is consistent with an essentially hard-sphere interaction between the particles. Metastable fluid states were obtained upon shear melting the crystalline phases by tumbling the samples. Their intermediate scattering functions, measured by dynamic light scattering, showed the emergence of a nondecaying component, implying structural arrest, at essentially the same concentration as that at which homogeneously nucleated crystallization was no longer observed. The overall forms of the intermediate scattering functions are consistent with the predictions of mode-coupling theories for the glass transition. Supplementary studies of the static structure factors indicated only short-ranged spatial order for particle concentrations ranging from the equilibrium fluid through the metastable fluid to the glass.},

The subject is divided into four parts, three of them dealing with behavior in different domains of temperature with respect to the glass transition temperature, Tg, and a fourth dealing with  ” short time processes.” The first part tackles the high temperature regime {T\&gt;Tg}, in which the system is ergodic and the evolution of the viscous liquid toward the condition at Tg is in focus. The second part deals with the regime {T∼Tg}, where the system is nonergodic except for very long annealing times, hence has time-dependent properties (aging and annealing). The third part discusses behavior when the system is completely frozen with respect to the primary relaxation process but in which secondary processes, particularly those responsible for  ” superionic” conductivity, and dopart mobility in amorphous silicon, remain active. In the fourth part we focus on the behavior of the system at the crossover between the low frequency vibrational components of the molecular motion and its high frequency relaxational components, paying particular attention to very recent developments in the short time dielectric response and the high Q mechanical response. {\copyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

The optical properties of the particles are such that the relative contrast of the two species is very sensitive to temperature, a feature that is exploited to obtain the three partial coherent intermediate scattering functions. The glass transition is identified by the onset of structural arrest, or arrest of the α process, on the time scale of the experiment. This is observed in a one-component suspension at a packing fraction of 0.575. The intermediate scattering functions measured on the mixtures quantify how, on introduction of the smaller spheres, the α process is released, i.e., how the glass melts. Increasing the fraction of smaller particles causes the α process to speed up but, at a given wave vector, also incurs a change to its amplitude in proportion to the change in the (partial) structure factor.},

We illustrate our approach with two classes of models. One depicts diffusion in a strong glass former, and the other in a fragile glass former. At low temperatures, both models exhibit violation of the {Stokes-Einstein} relation, D∼τ−1, where D is the self-diffusion constant and τ is the structural relaxation time. In the strong case, the violation is sensitive to dimensionality d, going as D∼τ−2∕3 for d=1 and as D∼τ−0.95 for d=3. In the fragile case, however, we argue that dimensionality dependence is weak, and show that for d=1, D∼τ−0.73. This scaling for the fragile case compares favorably with the results of a recent experimental study for a three-dimensional fragile glass former.},

We employ a simple model of dynamic changes of the rotational speed of a single molecule. This dynamic heterogeneity model is based on a Gaussian distribution of activation energies in a {VFTH} ({Vogel-Fulcher}-{Tammann-Hesse}) type temperature dependence of the polymer viscosity. The simulations explain all experimental details concerning the stretched exponential single molecule relaxation dynamics and the related distributions.

We discuss several experimental issues (sedimentation, thermal control, non-equilibrium ageing effects, dynamic heterogeneity) arising when very large relaxation times are measured. When analyzed over more than seven decades in time, we find that the equilibrium relaxation time, τ α , of our system is described by the algebraic divergence predicted by mode-coupling theory over a window of about three decades. At higher density, τ α  increases exponentially with distance to a critical volume fraction  0 , which is much larger than the mode-coupling singularity. This is reminiscent of the behavior of molecular glass-formers in the activated regime.

@article{Qin2003Viscosity,
    abstract = {In this paper, recent advances in the study of rheological behavior of concentrated bimodal suspensions are briefly reviewed. The predictive models are divided into two categories, namely, the effective volume fraction (or hard sphere scaling) approach and the separation of contributions approach. Predictions of both approaches are compared with experimental data of electrostatically and sterically stabilized suspensions. It is shown that the predictions of both hard sphere scaling and the scaling method of Zaman and Moudgil (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 212 (1999) 167) to separate the contributions of fine and coarse particles are in good agreement with the experimentally observed results. The approach by Dames, Morrison, Wilenbacher (Rheol. Acta 40 (2001) 434) to separate the hard-sphere and non-hard-sphere contributions is investigated using the aqueous silica and polystyrene suspensions respectively. A good agreement is shown for aqueous silica suspensions. However, significant differences between the predictions and experimental data are found for the sterically stabilized polystyrene suspensions, suggesting a more generalized expression is needed. As an attempt to classify the models on the viscosity of colloidal suspensions, the present study will provide guidelines for interpretation of experimental results and for the development of more comprehensive predictive methodologies for polydispersed colloidal dispersions.},

@article{Sierou2001Accelerated,
    abstract = {A new implementation of the conventional Stokesian Dynamics ({SD}) algorithm, called accelerated Stokesian Dynamics ({ASD}), is presented. The equations governing the motion of N particles suspended in a viscous fluid at low particle Reynolds number are solved accurately and efficiently, including all hydrodynamic interactions, but with a significantly lower computational cost of {O(N} ln N). The main differences from the conventional {SD} method lie in the calculation of the many-body long-range interactions, where the Ewald-summed wave-space contribution is calculated as a Fourier transform sum and in the iterative inversion of the now sparse resistance matrix. The new method is applied to problems in the rheology of both structured and random suspensions, and accurate results are obtained with much larger numbers of particles. With access to larger N, the high-frequency dynamic viscosities and short-time self-diffusivities of random suspensions for volume fractions above the freezing point are now studied. The {ASD} method opens up an entire new class of suspension problems that can be investigated, including particles of non-spherical shape and a distribution of sizes, and the method can readily be extended to other {low-Reynolds}-number-flow problems.},

Simulations are performed over a wide range of volume fraction phi and Peclet number Pe = (gamma) over {dota(2)/D}, where (gamma) over dot is the shear rate and D = {kT}/6 pi eta a is the {Stokes-Einstein} diffusivity of an isolated spherical particle of radius a and thermal energy {kT} in a fluid of viscosity eta. At low Pe, the viscosity decreases as Pe increases-the suspension shear thins. The first normal stress difference is positive, while the second normal stress difference is negative. Each normal stress difference vanishes at very low Pe and increases in magnitude to an extremum at Pe approximate to 3. The suspension pressure is proportional to {kT} and is found to grow as Pe(2) from its equilibrium value. Long-time self-diffusivities scale as D and grow as Pe is increased in this regime. At Pe approximate to 100, the suspension undergoes a disorder-order transition to a microstructure of hexagonally packed strings aligned in the flow direction, which is accompanied by precipitous drops in the viscosity, pressure and long-time self diffusivities. At high Pe, all components of the stress tensor scale as eta(gamma) over dot and the diffusivities scale as (gamma) over dota(2).

We use confocal microscopy to investigate the motion of colloidal particles near the colloidal glass transition.

This prevents them from diffusing freely throughout the sample. We quantify the properties of these cages by measuring temporal anticorrelations of the particles' displacements. The local cage properties are related to the subdiffusive rise of the mean square displacement: over a broad range of time scales, the mean square displacement grows slower than linearly in time.},

The  ” fragility” quantifies how sensitively the relaxation time scale depends on the area fraction, and the fragility strongly depends on the composition of the mixture. We confirm prior results for mixtures of particles with similar sizes, where the ability to form small crystalline regions correlates with fragility. However, for mixtures with particle size ratios above 1.4, we find that the fragility is not correlated with structural ordering, but rather with the spatial distribution of large particles. The large particles have slower motion than the small particles and act as confining  ” walls” which slow the motion of nearby small particles. The rearrangement of these confining structures governs the lifetime of dynamical heterogeneity, that is, how long local regions exhibit anomalously fast or slow behavior. The strength of the confinement effect is correlated with the fragility and also influences the aging behavior of glassy systems.},

However, one of their major limitations is blinking, an intermittent loss of fluorescence, characteristic of individual and small clusters of {QDs}, that interrupts particle tracking. Recently, several research groups have reported  ” nonblinking {QDs}”. However, blinking is the primary method used to confirm nanoparticle aggregation status in situ, and single or small clusters of nanoparticles with continuous fluorescence emission are difficult to discern from large aggregates. Here, we describe a new class of quantum dot-based composite nanoparticles that solve these two seemingly irreconcilable problems by exhibiting near-continuous, alternating-color fluorescence, which permits aggregation status discrimination by observable color changes even during motion across the focal plane. These materials will greatly enhance particle tracking in cell biology, biophysics, and fluid mechanics.},

Here, we introduce a confined displacement algorithm based on image correlation spectroscopy in combination with Manders colocalization coefficients {M1ROI} and {M2ROI} to quantify true and random colocalization of a given florescence pattern. We show that existing algorithms based on block scrambling exaggerate the randomization of fluorescent patterns with resulting inappropriately narrow probability density functions and false significance of true colocalization in terms of p values. We further confine our approach to subcellular compartments and show that true and random colocalization can be analysed for model dendrites and for {GABAB} receptor subunits {GABABR1}/2 in cultured hippocampal neurons. Together, we demonstrate that the confined displacement algorithm detects true colocalization of specific fluorescence patterns down to subcellular levels.},

@article{Bolte2006Guided,
    abstract = {
                It is generally accepted that the functional compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells is reflected by the differential occurrence of proteins in their compartments. The location and physiological function of a protein are closely related; local information of a protein is thus crucial to understanding its role in biological processes. The visualization of proteins residing on intracellular structures by fluorescence microscopy has become a routine approach in cell biology and is increasingly used to assess their colocalization with well-characterized markers. However, image-analysis methods for colocalization studies are a field of contention and enigma. We have therefore undertaken to review the most currently used colocalization analysis methods, introducing the basic optical concepts important for image acquisition and subsequent analysis. We provide a summary of practical tips for image acquisition and treatment that should precede proper colocalization analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the application and feasibility of colocalization tools for various biological colocalization situations and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We have created a novel toolbox for subcellular colocalization analysis under {ImageJ}, named {JACoP}, that integrates current global statistic methods and a novel object-based approach.

    abstract = {
                We introduce a novel statistical approach that quantifies, for the first time, the amount of colocalization of two fluorescent-labeled proteins in an image automatically, removing the bias of visual interpretation. This is done by estimating simultaneously the maximum threshold of intensity for each color below which pixels do not show any statistical correlation. The sensitivity of the method was illustrated on simulated data by statistically confirming the existence of true colocalization in images with as little as 3\% colocalization. This method was then tested on a large three-dimensional set of fixed cells cotransfected with {CFP}/{YFP} pairs of proteins that either co-compartmentalized, interacted, or were just randomly localized in the nucleolus. In this test, the algorithm successfully distinguished random color overlap from colocalization due to either co-compartmentalization or interaction, and results were verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The accuracy and consistency of our algorithm was further illustrated by measuring, for the first time in live cells, the dissociation rate (k(d)) of the {HIV}-1 {Rev/CRM1} export complex induced by the cytotoxin leptomycin B. {Rev/CRM1} colocalization in nucleoli dropped exponentially after addition of leptomycin B at a rate of 1.25 x 10(-3) s(-1). More generally, this algorithm can be used to answer a variety of biological questions involving protein-protein interactions or co-compartmentalization and can be generalized to colocalization of more than two colors.

    abstract = {Biomolecular interactions are fundamental to the vast majority of cellular processes, and identification of the major interacting components is usually the first step toward an understanding of the mechanisms that govern various cell functions. Thus, statistical image analyses that can be performed on fluorescence microscopy images of fixed or live cells have been routinely applied for biophysical and cell biological studies. These approaches measure the fraction of interacting particles by analyzing dual color fluorescence images for colocalized pixels. Colocalization algorithms have proven to be effective, although the dynamic range and accuracy of these measurements has never been well established. Spatial image cross-correlation spectroscopy ({ICCS}), which cross-correlates spatial intensity fluctuations recorded in images from two detection channels simultaneously, has also recently been shown to be an effective measure of colocalization as well. Through simulations, imaging of fluorescent antibodies adsorbed on glass and cell measurements, we show that {ICCS} performs much better than standard colocalization algorithms at moderate to high densities of particles, which are often encountered in cellular systems. Furthermore, it was found that the density ratio between the two labeled species of interest plays a major role in the accuracy of the colocalization analysis. By applying a direct and systematic comparison between the standard, fluorescence microscopy colocalization algorithm and spatial {ICCS}, we show regimes where each approach is applicable, and more importantly, where they fail to yield accurate results.},

The suspensions consisted of sterically stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) spheres of diameters about 670 and 407 nm suspended in a near refractive indexed matched suspension medium composed of carbon disulphide and cis‐decalin. With increasing volume fraction, binary suspensions of number fraction of larger component A {xA}\&gt;0.43 crystallized to give irregularly stacked close packed crystals containing almost entirely component A. As the number fraction {xA} decreased, the rate of crystallization decreased. Suspensions of {xA}≊0.28 remained amorphous and showed glassy behavior. Suspensions of {xA}≊0.057 showed a complex sequence of phase behavior with coexistence of crystals of component B, the ordered binary alloy phase {AB13}, and a binary fluid. In suspensions with {xA}\&lt;0.057, the only solid phase observed was irregularly stacked close packed crystals of component B. The observed phase behavior is compared with the predictions of a model for freezing of a mixture of hard spheres which are assumed to be immiscible in the solid phase.},

@article{Chen2011Directed,
    abstract = {
                A challenging goal in materials chemistry and physics is spontaneously to form intended superstructures from designed building blocks. In fields such as crystal engineering and the design of porous materials, this typically involves building blocks of organic molecules, sometimes operating together with metallic ions or clusters. The translation of such ideas to nanoparticles and colloidal-sized building blocks would potentially open doors to new materials and new properties, but the pathways to achieve this goal are still undetermined. Here we show how colloidal spheres can be induced to self-assemble into a complex predetermined colloidal crystal-in this case a colloidal kagome lattice-through decoration of their surfaces with a simple pattern of hydrophobic domains. The building blocks are simple micrometre-sized spheres with interactions (electrostatic repulsion in the middle, hydrophobic attraction at the poles, which we call 'triblock Janus') that are also simple, but the self-assembly of the spheres into an open kagome structure contrasts with previously known close-packed periodic arrangements of spheres. This open network is of interest for several theoretical reasons. With a view to possible enhanced functionality, the resulting lattice structure possesses two families of pores, one that is hydrophobic on the rims of the pores and another that is hydrophilic. This strategy of 'convergent' self-assembly from easily fabricated colloidal building blocks encodes the target supracolloidal architecture, not in localized attractive spots but instead in large redundantly attractive regions, and can be extended to form other supracolloidal networks.

@article{Clack2008Electrostatic,
    abstract = {{DNA} microarrays are used for gene-expression profiling, single-nucleotide polymorphism detection and disease diagnosis1, 2, 3. A persistent challenge in this area is the lack of microarray screening technology suitable for integration into routine clinical care4, 5. Here, we describe a method for sensitive and label-free electrostatic readout of {DNA} or {RNA} hybridization on microarrays. The electrostatic properties of the microarray are measured from the position and motion of charged microspheres randomly dispersed over the surface. We demonstrate nondestructive electrostatic imaging with 10-μm lateral resolution over centimeter-length scales, which is four-orders of magnitude larger than that achievable with conventional scanning electrostatic force microscopy. Changes in surface charge density as a result of specific hybridization can be detected and quantified with {50-pM} sensitivity, single base-pair mismatch selectivity and in the presence of complex background. Because the naked eye is sufficient to read out hybridization, this approach may facilitate broad application of multiplexed assays.},

The particles? physical properties were controlled by adjusting two reaction parameters, the initiator and chain transfer agent concentrations, which influence the molecular weight of the {PMMA}. Under certain conditions, particles with the requisite properties for fabricating colloidal clusters were synthesized. The resulting clusters represent a new type of nonspherical colloid that can be dispersed in a density- and refractive index-matching solvent, making them ideal for quantitative studies using confocal microscopy. To demonstrate the utility of our clusters, we measured the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of a tetrahedral cluster by tracking the motion of its constituent particles in three-dimensional space. More broadly, our findings provide new insights concerning {PMMA} dispersion polymerization in apolar media.},

@article{Challis1995Procedure,
    abstract = {For many biomechanical applications it is necessary to determine the parameters which describe the transformation of a rigid body from one reference frame to another. These parameters are a scaling factor, an attitude matrix, and a translation vector. The paper presents a new procedure for the determination of these parameters incorporating the work of Arun et al. [{IEEE} Trans. Pattern Anal. Machine Intell, 9, 698–700 (1987)] but expanding their analysis to allow for the determination of a scale factor, the scalar weighting of the least-squares problem, and the problem of obtaining the incorrect determinant when determining the attitude matrix. The procedure, which requires the coordinates of three or more noncollinear points, is based around the singular value decomposition, and provides a least-squares estimate of the rigid body transformation parameters. Examples are presented of the use of this procedure for determining the attitude of a rigid body, and for osteometric scaling. When used for osteometric scaling mirror transformations are possible, therefore a right-hand specimen can be scaled to the left-hand side of another specimen.},

@article{Scheidler2004Relaxation,
    abstract = {We present the results of molecular dynamics computer simulations of a binary {Lennard-Jones} liquid confined between two parallel rough walls. These walls are realized by frozen amorphous configurations of the same liquid and therefore the structural properties of the confined fluid are identical to the ones of the bulk system. Hence, this setup allows us to study how the relaxation dynamics is affected by the pure effect of confinement, i.e., if structural changes are completely avoided. We find that the local relaxation dynamics is a strong function of z, the distance of the particles from the wall, and that close to the surface the typical relaxation times are orders of magnitude larger than the ones in the bulk. Because of the cooperative nature of the particle dynamics, the slow dynamics also affects the dynamics of the particles for large values of z. Using various empirical laws, we are able to parametrize accurately the z dependence of the generalized incoherent intermediate scattering function Fs(q,z,t) and also the spatial dependence of structural relaxation times. These laws allow us to determine various dynamical length scales and we find that their temperature dependence is compatible with an Arrhenius law. Furthermore, we find that, at low temperatures, time- and space-dependent correlation functions fulfill a generalized factorization property similar to the one predicted by mode-coupling theory for bulk systems. For thin films and/or at sufficiently low temperatures, we find that the relaxation dynamics is influenced by the two walls in a strongly nonlinear way in that the slowing down is much stronger than the one expected from the presence of only one confining wall. Finally, we study the average dynamics of all liquid particles and find that the data can be described very well by a superposition of two relaxation processes that have clearly separated time scales. Since this is in contrast with the result of our analysis of the local dynamics, we argue that a correct interpretation of experimental data can be rather difficult.},

The {CdSe} {QDs} embedded in the core were coated with the higher band gap semiconductor materials {CdS} and {ZnS} in a successive ion layer adsorption reaction ({SILAR}) keeping up the light-emitting properties of the {QDs} during the integration process. A modifying influence of the photonic band structure of the {PC} on the photoluminescence ({PL}) of the embedded {QDs} was observed by angular-dependent fluorescence measurements. The controlled combination of electronic confinement, originating from the {QDs}, and photon confinement, due to the periodic dielectric structure of the colloidal crystal, as it has been realized in this work presents a huge platform for the design and construction of novel optoelectronic devices based on {PCs}.},

Furthermore, we show that two-time correlation functions show a strong dependence on the waiting time elapsed since the quench and that their shape is very different from the one in equilibrium. By investigating the temperature and time dependence of the frequency distribution of the normal modes we show that the energy of the inherent structures can be used to define an effective (time-dependent) temperature of the aging system.},

@article{Cui2002Equilibrium,
    abstract = {We report the results of studies, using digital video microscopy, of the spatial distribution of particles in a quasi-one-dimensional colloidal liquid. The system studied consists of a water suspension of silica particles with diameter σ=1.58 μ m confined in a 3 μ m ×3 μ m ×2  mm silicone elastomer channel. The measured spatial distributions have been characterized by the nearest-neighbor distribution function and the pair correlation function, and the pair correlation function has been inverted, using the hypernetted chain approximation, to yield the effective colloid–colloid interaction. The effective colloid–colloid interaction is found to have an attractive potential well with depth of ∼0.3k B T at a colloid-colloid separation R≈1.18σ. Molecular-dynamics simulations of the nearest neighbor and pair correlation functions carried out using the empirically determined colloid–colloid interaction are in very good agreement with the experimental data. The experimental data obtained rule out any important charge–charge contribution to the measured colloid–colloid interaction. It is suggested that because the host liquid does not wet the channel wall, and the colloid particles are tightly confined in the long narrow channel, capillary forces determine the effective colloid–colloid interaction. This suggestion is consistent with the determination (also reported) that the effective colloid–colloid interaction in a quasi-two-dimensional suspension of the same particles is different from that in the quasi-one dimensional suspension.},

    abstract = {We study the correlated Brownian motion of micron-sized particles suspended in water and confined between two plates. The hydrodynamic interaction between the particles exhibits three anomalies. (i) The transverse coupling is negative; i.e., particles exert  ” antidrag” on one another when moving perpendicular to their connecting line. (ii) The interaction decays with interparticle distance r as 1/r2, faster than in unconfined suspensions but slower than near a single wall. (iii) At large distances, the pair interaction is independent of concentration within the experimental accuracy. The confined suspension thus provides an unusual example of long-range, yet essentially pairwise, correlations even at high concentration. These effects are shown to arise from the two-dimensional dipolar form of the flow induced by single-particle motion.},

In this region, several dynamic crossovers have been experimentally and numerically revealed in the past years and the onset of glassy behavior is generally located, because of cooperative and heterogeneous features exhibited by the dynamics. In this Article, the rotational dynamics of two different stiff molecular spin probes dissolved in poly(propylene glycol) has been investigated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy in a wide temperature range. Decoupling phenomena between macroscopic and microscopic transport properties have been observed in the crossover region. A comparison with previous studies carried out with the same tracers dissolved in different polymers and glass formers strongly supports the idea that the observed crossover signals the onset of spatial correlations of dynamics on the length scale probed by the tracers.},

It is found that the system exhibits a kinetic glass transition, detected as a crossover from hydrodynamic relaxation to a relaxation dominated by hopping processes. The kinetic transition occurs at significantly smaller densities than that of the bulk glass transition. In particular, the dependence of this density shift on the plate distance L is studied for systems involving 3 to 16 microscopic layers in between the plates. As a result, the density shift scales approximately proportionally to {exp(-L}/l0) where l0 is a microscopic length scale. Furthermore, the kinetic glass transition is a collective effect that occurs simultaneously in each layer.},

The addition of {H2O2} to suspensions of unpurified {SWNTs} results in a rapid (1−2 h) quenching of the photoluminescence from all tubes, whereas {H2O2} addition to acid-purified {SWNTs} causes the nanotube {PL} to grow in intensity over a period of several days before decaying in a tube-specific manner that depends on the binding strength of the surfactant sheath. With the appropriate choice of surfactants, the {PL} for specific acid-purified {SWNTs} can be protected such that novel mid-gap and phonon-assisted absorption and emission transitions can be observed without the obscuring effects associated with emission from other nanotubes. The {H2O2} treatment also results in a reduction of the high-energy absorption background that has been associated with either carbonaceous impurities or the {SWNT} π-plasmon oscillation. An understanding of the related mechanisms leads to a new method for separating nanotubes by type based on selective oxidation followed by selective precipitation.

The rate of loss of {PL} intensity was measured for 12 different nanotubes in three common aqueous surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate, {SDS}; sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, {SDBS}; and sodium cholate, {SC}) as the surfactant suspensions were diluted to promote nanotube rebundling, quenching of semiconductor nanotube {PL}, and precipitation. The rate of {PL} decay was first-order in the concentration of isolated nanotubes, as expected if surfactant desorption is rate-limiting in the rebundling process. Temperature-dependent measurements permitted an Arrhenius analysis from which diameter-dependent activation energies were determined. {SDS} was found to have very strong diameter dependence for activation energy, with stronger binding to smaller-diameter nanotubes, whereas {SDBS} displayed a weaker diameter dependence. {SC} was found to bind strongly to certain nanotubes and weakly to the (10,2) nanotube. The {PL} emission red shifted with time after dilution as surfactant desorption proceeded. This effect is attributed to an increase in the micropolarity at the nanotube surface.},

@article{Sahoo2010Polymer,
    abstract = {Carbon nanotubes ({CNTs}) exhibit excellent mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties as well as nanometer scale diameter and high aspect ratio, which make them an ideal reinforcing agent for high strength polymer composites. However, since {CNTs} usually form stabilized bundles due to Van der Waals interactions, are extremely difficult to disperse and align in a polymer matrix. The biggest issues in the preparation of {CNT}-reinforced composites reside in efficient dispersion of {CNTs} into a polymer matrix, the assessment of the dispersion, and the alignment and control of the {CNTs} in the matrix. There are several methods for the dispersion of nanotubes in the polymer matrix such as solution mixing, melt mixing, electrospinning, in-situ polymerization and chemical functionalization of the carbon nanotubes, etc. These methods and preparation of high performance {CNT}-polymer composites are described in this review. A critical comparison of various {CNT} functionalization methods is given. In particular, {CNT} functionalization using click chemistry and the preparation of {CNT} composites employing hyperbranched polymers are stressed as potential techniques to achieve good {CNT} dispersion. In addition, discussions on mechanical, thermal, electrical, electrochemical and optical properties and applications of {polymer/CNT} composites are included.},

    abstract = {Field-effect transistors were fabricated using high-density single-walled carbon nanotube ({SWNT}) thin films directly grown on suitable substrates. Such approach eliminated the variations of device behaviors in individual {SWNT} devices by utilizing a large number of {SWNTs} in each device. We have found that the behaviors of such devices are closely related to the surface charge densities around {SWNTs} in aqueous solutions. Adsorption of ionic surfactants on the surface could significantly modulate the device characteristics, which could be detected by measuring the conductance of the devices. The devices could be tuned to be sensitive to either anionic or cationic surfactants by tailoring the surface properties of {SiO2} substrates around {SWNTs}. This effect could be potentially used to design chemical and biological sensors.},

@article{Zheng2003DNAassisted,
    abstract = {Carbon nanotubes are man-made one-dimensional carbon crystals with different diameters and chiralities. Owing to their superb mechanical and electrical properties, many potential applications have been proposed for them. However, polydispersity and poor solubility in both aqueous and non-aqueous solution impose a considerable challenge for their separation and assembly, which is required for many applications. Here we report our finding of {DNA}-assisted dispersion and separation of carbon nanotubes. Bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes are effectively dispersed in water by their sonication in the presence of single-stranded {DNA} ({ssDNA}). Optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements provide evidence for individually dispersed carbon nanotubes. Molecular modelling suggests that {ssDNA} can bind to carbon nanotubes through -stacking, resulting in helical wrapping to the surface. The binding free energy of {ssDNA} to carbon nanotubes rivals that of two nanotubes for each other. We also demonstrate that {DNA}-coated carbon nanotubes can be separated into fractions with different electronic structures by ion-exchange chromatography. This finding links one of the central molecules in biology to a technologically very important nanomaterial, and opens the door to carbon-nanotube-based applications in biotechnology.},

@article{Liu2009Carbon,
    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Carbon} nanotubes exhibit many unique intrinsic physical and chemical properties and have been intensively explored for biological and biomedical applications in the past few years. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the main results from our and other groups in this field and clarify that surface functionalization is critical to the behavior of carbon nanotubes in biological systems. Ultrasensitive detection of biological species with carbon nanotubes can be realized after surface passivation to inhibit the non-specific binding of biomolecules on the hydrophobic nanotube surface. Electrical nanosensors based on nanotubes provide a label-free approach to biological detection. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes opens up a method of protein microarray with detection sensitivity down to 1 {fmol/L}. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies reveal that highly water soluble and serum stable nanotubes are biocompatible, nontoxic, and potentially useful for biomedical applications. In vivo biodistributions vary with the functionalization and possibly also size of nanotubes, with a tendency to accumulate in the reticuloendothelial system ({RES}), including the liver and spleen, after intravenous administration. If well functionalized, nanotubes may be excreted mainly through the biliary pathway in feces. Carbon nanotube-based drug delivery has shown promise in various In vitro and in vivo experiments including delivery of small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}), paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Moreover, single-walled carbon nanotubes with various interesting intrinsic optical properties have been used as novel photoluminescence, Raman, and photoacoustic contrast agents for imaging of cells and animals. Further multidisciplinary explorations in this field may bring new opportunities in the realm of biomedicine.},

@article{See2007Review,
    abstract = {Carbon nanotubes ({CNTs}) are crystalline, tubular, carbon structures with extraordinary mechanical, chemical, optical, and electrical properties. These unique properties make {CNTs} potentially valuable in a wide range of end-use applications. Currently, research into nanotubes and their applications is hampered by the lack of a suitable technique for manufacturing them in large quantities, which we define here as 10 000 tons per plant per year. Consequently, research into large-scale manufacturing techniques is ongoing. There are three established methods of {CNT} synthesis:  (i) arc discharge, (ii) laser ablation, and (iii) chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}). Of these, {CVD} techniques show the greatest promise for economically viable, large-scale synthesis, based upon yields reported in the literature and the inherent scalability of similar technologies, e.g., fluidized catalytic cracking. In particular, the fluidized-bed {CVD} ({FBCVD}) technique (where the {CVD} reaction occurs within a fluidized bed of catalyst particles) has the potential to produce high-quality {CNTs}, inexpensively in large quantities. In this work, we review the existing literature on {CNT} synthesis via {FBCVD} and demonstrate that no systematic study of the key parameters has been undertaken. We demonstrate that there is no clear understanding of the influence of key variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, and carbon source) on {CNT} properties (e.g., {CNT} diameter, length, and morphology), which shows that further research is necessary to optimize this process and, ultimately, understand the science behind {CNT} growth using this technique. We also highlight the assessment of {CNT} quality as being an issue for further research. {CNT} quality is usually characterized visually (e.g., from {TEM} images), and a standard {CNT} characterization protocol has yet to be elucidated. The successful scale-up of any process requires detailed understanding of key process parameters and their interactions. Hence, further research to optimize the purity, yield, and selectivity of the synthesized {CNTs} is required before the potential of this technique can be realized.},

However, the use of nanoparticles for small molecular weight, water-soluble drugs has been limited by poor drug encapsulation efficiency and rapid release of the encapsulated drug. Here we report enhanced cellular delivery of water-soluble molecules using novel Aerosol {OT}™ ({AOT})-alginate nanoparticles recently developed in our laboratory. Materials and {Methods\&nbsp;\&nbsp;AOT}-alginate nanoparticles were formulated using emulsion-crosslinking technology. Rhodamine and doxorubicin were used as model water-soluble molecules. Kinetics and mechanism of nanoparticle-mediated cellular drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle-encapsulated doxorubicin were evaluated in two model breast cancer cell lines. {Results\&nbsp;\&nbsp;AOT}-alginate nanoparticles demonstrated sustained release of doxorubicin over a 15-day period in vitro. Cell culture studies indicated that nanoparticles enhanced the cellular delivery of rhodamine by about two–tenfold compared to drug in solution. Nanoparticle uptake into cells was dose-, time- and energy-dependent. Treatment with nanoparticles resulted in significantly higher cellular retention of drug than treatment with drug in solution. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that doxorubicin in nanoparticles resulted in significantly higher and more sustained cytotoxicity than drug in solution. {Conclusions\&nbsp;\&nbsp;AOT}-alginate nanoparticles significantly enhance the cellular delivery of basic, water-soluble drugs. This translates into enhanced therapeutic efficacy for drugs like doxorubicin that have intracellular site of action. Based on these results, {AOT}-alginate nanoparticles appear to be suitable carriers for enhanced and sustained cellular delivery of basic, water-soluble drugs.},

Here we demonstrate a purification, deposition and fabrication process that yields devices consisting of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes with electronic characteristics vastly superior to those of circuits made from raw {HiPCO}. Source–drain current measurements on the circuits as a function of temperature and backgate voltage are used to quantify the energy gap of semiconducting nanotubes in a field-effect transistor geometry.

    abstract = {The cellular uptake and expulsion rates of length-fractionated single-walled carbon nanotubes ({SWNT}) from 130 to 660 nm in {NIH}-{3T3} cells were measured via single particle tracking of their intrinsic photoluminescence. We develop a quantitative model to correlate endocytosis rate with nanoparticle geometry that accurately describes this data set and also literature results for Au nanoparticles. The model asserts that nanoparticles cluster on the cell membrane to form a size sufficient to generate a large enough enthalpic contribution via receptor ligand interactions to overcome the elastic energy and entropic barriers associated with vesicle formation. Interestingly, the endocytosis rate constant of {SWNT} (10−3 min−1) is found to be nearly 1000 times that of Au nanoparticles (10−6 min−1) but the recycling (exocytosis) rate constants are similar in magnitude (10−4 to 10−3 min−1) for poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide), {SWNT}, and Au nanoparticles across distinct cell lines. The total uptake of both {SWNT} and Au nanoparticles is maximal at a common radius of 25 nm when scaled using an effective capture dimension for membrane diffusion. The ability to understand and predict the cellular uptake of nanoparticles quantitatively should find utility in designing nanosystems with controlled toxicity, efficacy, and functionality.},

However, biocompatible single-walled carbon nanotubes with high quantum yield have been elusive. Here, we show that sonicating single-walled carbon nanotubes with sodium cholate, followed by surfactant exchange to form phospholipid–polyethylene glycol coated nanotubes, produces in vivo imaging agents that are both bright and biocompatible. The exchange procedure is better than directly sonicating the tubes with the phospholipid–polyethylene glycol, because it results in less damage to the nanotubes and improves the quantum yield. We show whole-animal in vivo imaging using an {InGaAs} camera in the 1–1.7 µm spectral range by detecting the intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence of the 'exchange' single-walled carbon nanotubes at a low dose (17 mg l−1 injected dose).

@article{Tu2009DNA,
    abstract = {Single-walled carbon nanotubes ({SWNTs}) are a family of molecules that have the same cylindrical shape but different chiralities1. Many fundamental studies and technological applications2 of {SWNTs} require a population of tubes with identical chirality that current syntheses cannot provide. The {SWNT} sorting problem—that is, separation of a synthetic mixture of tubes into individual single-chirality components—has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Intense efforts so far have focused largely on, and resulted in solutions for, a weaker version of the sorting problem: metal/semiconductor separation3, 4. A systematic and general method to purify each and every single-chirality species of the same electronic type from the synthetic mixture of {SWNTs} is highly desirable, but the task has proven to be insurmountable to date. Here we report such a method, which allows purification of all 12 major single-chirality semiconducting species from a synthetic mixture, with sufficient yield for both fundamental studies and application development. We have designed an effective search of a {DNA} library of \~{}1060 in size, and have identified more than 20 short {DNA} sequences, each of which recognizes and enables chromatographic purification of a particular nanotube species from the synthetic mixture. Recognition sequences exhibit a periodic purine–pyrimidines pattern, which can undergo hydrogen-bonding to form a two-dimensional sheet, and fold selectively on nanotubes into a well-ordered three-dimensional barrel. We propose that the ordered two-dimensional sheet and three-dimensional barrel provide the structural basis for the observed {DNA} recognition of {SWNTs}.},

As expected, the red-shift of the surface plasmon resonance peak, as well as the drop of surface charge and the increase of the hydrodynamic diameter indicated the conjugation of proteins to {NPs}. Remarkably, an evolution from a loosely attached toward an irreversible attached protein corona over time was observed.

@article{Ghosh2010Advanced,

Density-gradient ultracentrifugation has recently emerged as a technique for sorting as-grown mixtures of single-walled nanotubes into their distinct (n,m) structural forms, but to date this approach has been limited to samples containing only a small number of nanotube structures, and has often required repeated density-gradient ultracentrifugation processing. Here, we report that the use of tailored nonlinear density gradients can significantly improve density-gradient ultracentrifugation separations. We show that highly polydisperse samples of single-walled nanotubes grown by the {HiPco} method are readily sorted in a single step to give fractions enriched in any of ten different (n,m) species. Furthermore, minor variants of the method allow separation of the mirror-image isomers (enantiomers) of seven (n,m) species. Optimization of this approach was aided by the development of instrumentation that spectroscopically maps nanotube contents inside undisturbed centrifuge tubes.},

Significant quantities of the separated {SWCNTs} ranging in average length from <50 nm to ∼2 μm were produced, with the distribution width being coupled to the rate of the separation. Less rapid separation is shown to produce narrower distributions; these length fractions, produced using sodium deoxycholate dispersed {SWCNTs}, were characterized by {UV}−visible−near-infrared absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, Raman scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Several parameters of the separation were additionally explored: {SWCNT} concentration, added salt concentration, liquid density, rotor speed, surfactant concentration, and the processing temperature. The centrifugation technique is shown to support 10 mg per day scale processing and is applicable to all of the major {SWCNT} production methods. The cost per unit of the centrifugation-based separation is also demonstrated to be significantly less than size exclusion chromatography-based separations.},

Double-wall nanotubes are ideal systems for studying the interwall interactions influencing the properties of nanotubes with two or more walls. However, current techniques to synthesize double-wall nanotubes produce unwanted single- and multiwall nanotubes. Here, we show how density gradient ultracentrifugation can be used to separate double-wall nanotubes from mixtures of single- and multiwall nanotubes through differences in their buoyant density. This technique results in samples that are highly enriched in either single- or double-wall nanotubes of similar outer wall diameter, with the double-wall nanotubes being, on average, 44\% longer than the single-wall nanotubes. The longer average length of the double-wall nanotubes provides distinct advantages when they are used in transparent conductors.},

@article{Pease2009Length,
    abstract = {The first characterization of the length distribution of single-walled carbon nanotubes ({SWCNT}) dispersed in a liquid by electrospray differential mobility analysis ({ES}-{DMA}) is presented. Although an understanding of geometric properties of {SWCNTs}, including length, diameter, aspect ratio, and chirality, is essential for commercial applications, rapid characterization of nanotube length distributions remains challenging. Here the use of {ES}-{DMA} to obtain length distributions of {DNA}-wrapped {SWCNTs} dispersed in aqueous solutions is demonstrated. Lengths measured by {ES}-{DMA} compare favorably with those obtained from multiangle light scattering, dynamic light scattering, field flow fractionation with {UV}/vis detection, and atomic force microscopy, validating {ES}-{DMA} as a technique to measure {SWCNTs} of \&lt;250 nm in length. The nanotubes are previously purified and dispersed by wrapping with oligomeric {DNA} in aqueous solution and centrifuging to remove bundles and amorphous carbon. These dispersions are particularly attractive due to their amenability to bulk processing, ease of storage, high concentration, compatibility with biological and high-throughput manufacturing environments, and for their potential applications ranging from electronics and hydrogen-storage vessels to anticancer agents.},

@article{Huh2010Separation,
    abstract = {Surfactant-encapsulated double-wall carbon nanotubes ({DWCNTs}) synthesized by the high-pressure carbon monoxide decomposition ({HiPco}) process were separated by length and electronic characteristics using density gradient ultracentrifugation ({DGU}). To ensure our study focuses only on the behavior of {DWCNTs}, dispersed {DWCNTs} were first isolated following the method of Green et al. [Green, A. A.; Hersam, M. C. Nat. Nanotechnol. 2008, 264, 1], utilizing the differences in buoyant density of {DWCNTs} from that of impurity single-wall carbon nanotubes ({SWCNTs}) and multiwall carbon nanotubes contained in the parent soot. By increasing the density difference between the nanotubes and the density gradient medium, we exploited the length-dependent translation of the nanotubes in response to applied centrifugation to isolate narrow length distribution {DWCNT} fractions. The length-dependent intrinsic optical response of {DWCNTs} is consistent compared with the previously reported values for {SWCNTs}. The controlled addition of cosurfactants is shown to allow resolution of {DWCNTs} by electronic structure, as demonstrated through optical absorbance, Raman spectra, and electrical conductivity measurements. Measurements of conducting films prepared from separated fractions exhibit significant property differences in the enriched materials.},

@article{DalleFerrier2007Spatial,
    abstract = {We use recently introduced three-point dynamic susceptibilities to obtain an experimental determination of the temperature evolution of the number of molecules Ncorr that are dynamically correlated during the structural relaxation of supercooled liquids. We first discuss in detail the physical content of three-point functions that relate the sensitivity of the averaged two-time dynamics to external control parameters (such as temperature or density), as well as their connection to the more standard four-point dynamic susceptibility associated with dynamical heterogeneities. We then demonstrate that these functions can be experimentally determined with good precision. We gather available data to obtain the temperature dependence of Ncorr for a large number of supercooled liquids over a wide range of relaxation time scales from the glass transition up to the onset of slow dynamics. We find that Ncorr systematically grows when approaching the glass transition. It does so in a modest manner close to the glass transition, which is consistent with an activation-based picture of the dynamics in glassforming materials. For higher temperatures, there appears to be a regime where Ncorr behaves as a power-law of the relaxation time. Finally, we find that the dynamic response to density, while being smaller than the dynamic response to temperature, behaves similarly, in agreement with theoretical expectations.},

@article{Sacanna2010Lock,
    abstract = {New functional materials can in principle be created using colloids that self-assemble into a desired structure by means of a programmable recognition and binding scheme. This idea has been explored by attaching 'programmed' {DNA} strands to nanometre-1, 2, 3 and micrometre-4, 5 sized particles and then using {DNA} hybridization to direct the placement of the particles in the final assembly. Here we demonstrate an alternative recognition mechanism for directing the assembly of composite structures, based on particles with complementary shapes. Our system, which uses Fischer's lock-and-key principle6, employs colloidal spheres as keys and monodisperse colloidal particles with a spherical cavity as locks that bind spontaneously and reversibly via the depletion interaction. The lock-and-key binding is specific because it is controlled by how closely the size of a spherical colloidal key particle matches the radius of the spherical cavity of the lock particle. The strength of the binding can be further tuned by adjusting the solution composition or temperature. The composite assemblies have the unique feature of having flexible bonds, allowing us to produce flexible dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric colloidal molecules as well as more complex colloidal polymers. We expect that this lock-and-key recognition mechanism will find wider use as a means of programming and directing colloidal self-assembly.},

@article{Pregibon2007Multifunctional,
    abstract = {High-throughput screening for genetic analysis, combinatorial chemistry, and clinical diagnostics benefits from multiplexing, which allows for the simultaneous assay of several analytes but necessitates an encoding scheme for molecular identification. Current approaches for multiplexed analysis involve complicated or expensive processes for encoding, functionalizing, or decoding active substrates (particles or surfaces) and often yield a very limited number of analyte-specific codes. We present a method based on continuous-flow lithography that combines particle synthesis and encoding and probe incorporation into a single process to generate multifunctional particles bearing over a million unique codes. By using such particles, we demonstrate a multiplexed, single-fluorescence detection of {DNA} oligomers with encoded particle libraries that can be scanned rapidly in a flow-through microfluidic channel. Furthermore, we demonstrate with high specificity the same multiplexed detection using individual multiprobe particles. 10.1126/science.1134929},

@article{Eral2009Influence,
    abstract = {We used video microscopy and particle tracking to study the dynamics of confined hard-sphere suspensions. Our fluids consisted of  1.1- μ m -diameter silica spheres suspended at volume fractions of 0.33–0.42 in water-dimethyl sulfoxide. Suspensions were confined in a quasiparallel geometry between two glass surfaces: a millimeter-sized rough sphere and a smooth flat wall. First, as the separation distance  ( H )  is decreased from 18 to 1 particle diameter, a transition takes place from a subdiffusive behavior (as in bulk) at large  H , to completely caged particle dynamics at small  H . These changes are accompanied by a strong decrease in the amplitude of the mean-square displacement ({MSD}) in the horizontal plane parallel to the confining surfaces. In contrast, the global volume fraction essentially remains constant when  H  is decreased. Second, measuring the {MSD} as a function of distance from the confining walls, we found that the {MSD} is not spatially uniform but smaller close to the walls. This effect is the strongest near the smooth wall where layering takes place. Although confinement also induces local variations in volume fraction, the spatial variations in {MSD} can be attributed only partially to this effect. The changes in {MSD} are predominantly a direct effect of the confining surfaces. Hence, both the wall roughness and the separation distance  ( H )  influence the dynamics in confined geometries.},

The key dynamical variables are the time-dependent displacements of the particle center-of-mass and orientational angle. The {NMCT} predicts a kinetic arrest diagram with three dynamical states: ergodic fluid, plastic glass, and fully nonergodic double glass, the boundaries of which meet at a  ” triple point” corresponding to a most difficult to vitrify diatomic of aspect ratio \~{}1.43. The relative roles of rotation and translation in determining ideal kinetic arrest are explored by examining three limits of the theory corresponding to nonrotating, pure rotation, and rotationally ergodic models. The ideal kinetic arrest boundaries represent a crossover to activated dynamics described by two coupled stochastic nonlinear Langevin equations for translational and rotational motions. The fundamental quantity is a dynamic free-energy surface, which for small aspect ratios in the high-volume fraction regime exhibits two saddle points reflecting a two-step activated dynamics where relatively rapid rotational dynamics coexists with slower {CM} translational motions. For large-enough aspect ratios, the dynamic free-energy surface has one saddle point which corresponds to a system-specific coordinated translation-rotation motion. The entropic barriers as a function of the relative amount of rotation versus translation are determined.},

In confined geometries, the structural properties of random-packed systems will change. To understand these changes, we study random close packing in finite-sized confined systems, in both two and three dimensions. Each packing consists of a 50-50 binary mixture with particle size ratio of 1.4. The presence of confining walls significantly lowers the overall maximum area fraction (or volume fraction in three dimensions). A simple model is presented, which quantifies the reduction in packing due to wall-induced structure. This wall-induced structure decays rapidly away from the wall, with characteristic length scales comparable to the small particle diameter.},

At low ϕ the classic diffusive behavior of a fluid is observed. However, as ϕ is increased, temporary cages develop and particles become increasingly trapped by their neighbors. We statistically analyze particle trajectories and observe a number of robust features typically associated with dense molecular liquids and colloids. Even though our monodisperse and {quasi-2D} system is known to not exhibit a glass transition, we still observe many of the precursors usually associated with glassy dynamics.

@article{Hoffmann20093D,
    abstract = {We report on the translation and rotation of particle clusters made through the combination of spherical building blocks. These clusters present ideal model systems to study the motion of objects with complex shape. Since they could be separated into fractions of well-defined configurations on a sufficient scale and because their overall dimensions were below 300 nm, the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of particle doublets, triplets, and tetrahedrons could be determined by a combination of polarized dynamic light scattering ({DLS}) and depolarized dynamic light scattering ({DDLS}). The use of colloidal clusters for {DDLS} experiments overcomes the limitation of earlier experiments on the diffusion of complex objects near surfaces because the true {3D} diffusion can be studied. When the exact geometry of the complex assemblies is known, different hydrodynamic models for calculating the diffusion coefficients for objects with complex shapes could be applied. Because hydrodynamic friction must be restricted to the cluster surface, the so-called shell model, in which the surface is represented as a shell of small friction elements, was most suitable to describe the dynamics. A quantitative comparison of the predictions from theoretical modeling with the results obtained by {DDLS} showed an excellent agreement between experiment and theory.},

@article{Mattsson2009Soft,
    abstract = {Glass formation in colloidal suspensions has many of the hallmarks of glass formation in molecular materials1, 2, 3, 4, 5. For hard-sphere colloids, which interact only as a result of excluded volume, phase behaviour is controlled by volume fraction, φ; an increase in φ drives the system towards its glassy state, analogously to a decrease in temperature, T, in molecular systems. When φ increases above φ* ≈ 0.53, the viscosity starts to increase significantly, and the system eventually moves out of equilibrium at the glass transition, φg ≈ 0.58, where particle crowding greatly restricts structural relaxation1, 2, 3, 4. The large particle size makes it possible to study both structure and dynamics with light scattering1 and imaging3, 4; colloidal suspensions have therefore provided considerable insight into the glass transition. However, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions do not exhibit the same diversity of behaviour as molecular glasses. This is highlighted by the wide variation in behaviour observed for the viscosity or structural relaxation time, τα, when the glassy state is approached in supercooled molecular liquids5. This variation is characterized by the unifying concept of fragility5, which has spurred the search for a 'universal' description of dynamic arrest in glass-forming liquids. For 'fragile' liquids, τα is highly sensitive to changes in T, whereas non-fragile, or 'strong', liquids show a much lower T sensitivity. In contrast, hard-sphere colloidal suspensions are restricted to fragile behaviour, as determined by their φ dependence1, 6, ultimately limiting their utility in the study of the glass transition. Here we show that deformable colloidal particles, when studied through their concentration dependence at fixed temperature, do exhibit the same variation in fragility as that observed in the T dependence of molecular liquids at fixed volume. Their fragility is dictated by elastic properties on the scale of individual colloidal particles. Furthermore, we find an equivalent effect in molecular systems, where elasticity directly reflects fragility. Colloidal suspensions may thus provide new insight into glass formation in molecular systems.},

This is a new, crisper, and rather different addition to the examples of polyamorphism that have recently been studied. In order to deeply supercool the liquid, it must be quick-quenched to a low temperature: if heated slowly, but immediately, it crystallizes; if allowed to stand for several hours at low temperature, it transforms to the glacial phase; and if subsequently heated it, too, crystallizes, but at a higher temperature than that for liquid crystallization. The glacial phase can be clearly distinguished from both the normal crystal and the ordinary glass. We propose a model for the formation of this apparently amorphous glacial phase.},

    abstract = {Systems governed by time reversible equations of motion often give rise to irreversible behaviour1, 2, 3. The transition from reversible to irreversible behaviour is fundamental to statistical physics, but has not been observed experimentally in many-body systems. The flow of a newtonian fluid at low Reynolds number can be reversible: for example, if the fluid between concentric cylinders is sheared by boundary motion that is subsequently reversed, then all fluid elements return to their starting positions4. Similarly, slowly sheared suspensions of solid particles, which occur widely in nature and science5, are governed by time reversible equations of motion. Here we report an experiment showing precisely how time reversibility6 fails for slowly sheared suspensions. We find that there is a concentration dependent threshold for the deformation or strain beyond which particles do not return to their starting configurations after one or more cycles. Instead, their displacements follow the statistics of an anisotropic random walk7. By comparing the experimental results with numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the threshold strain is associated with a pronounced growth in the Lyapunov exponent (a measure of the strength of chaotic particle interactions). The comparison illuminates the connections between chaos, reversibility and predictability.},

Specifically we find a power-law increase as a function of ϕ-ϕc for {Z-Zc} with an exponent β around 0.5, and for P with an exponent ψ around 1.1. These exponents are in good agreement with simulations. We also find reasonable agreement with a recent mean-field theory for frictionless particles.},

@article{Dullens2005Topological,
    abstract = {Confocal scanning laser microscopy was used to study the behavior of dense suspensions of model colloidal hard spheres at a single wall. Due to the slight polydispersity, our system shows a reentrant melting transition at high densities involving a hexatic structure [R. P. A. Dullens and W. K. Kegel, Phys. Rev. Lett 92, 195702 (2004)]. The reentrant melting transition is accompanied by an increase in the mean-squared displacement. The correlation between structure and dynamics was quantitatively analyzed on a single-particle level. In particular, the topological lifetime, being the average time that a particle spends having the same coordination number, is determined for all coordination numbers and as a function of volume fraction. The defective (non-sixfold-coordinated) particles exhibit shorter lifetimes than sixfold-coordinated particles, indicating that the mobility of the system is larger at or close to defective particles. The lifetime itself is a strong function of volume fraction. In particular, the global behavior of the mean-squared displacement is proportional to the hopping frequency (the inverse of the lifetime), showing that particles changing their coordination number contribute most to the local mobility.},

We find that the onset of the deviation of the single-particle displacement distribution from Gaussian form starts in the liquid phase and extends; with increasing magnitude; through the hexatic phase into the crystalline phase. The time for which the deviation is maximum increases exponentially with the density. As the density increases toward the hexatic phase a third dynamical relaxation mode emerges. We argue that the collective motion is generated by superpositions of instantaneous normal mode vibrations; with lifetimes that increase with the density; along paths with strong bond-orientation correlation.},

@article{Angell2000Ten,
    abstract = {We formulate ten questions, covering outstanding aspects of the phenomenology of glassforming liquids, which we believe must be properly answered by any successful theory of structural glassformers. The questions range across thermodynamic, mass transport and vibrational dynamics phenomena. While these questions will only be addressed properly by a collective variables approach (many aspects of which are reported in these proceedings) a number of them can be dealt with by use of simple physical models of appropriate form. Here we discuss one such model in which the existence of elementary configurational excitations of the amorphous quasilattice is proposed. These states, which may range from broken bonds to packing defects, can be excited independently in the majority of cases, or cooperatively in others. We summarize essential results of this model. These suggest that the source of the different fragilities in liquids (and the reason that structural glasses, alone among `glassy' systems, have marked heat capacity jumps at Tg) may lie largely in the way these configurational excitations couple to the vibrational modes of the system. The generation of low frequency modes in the density of vibrational states, as a direct consequence of the excitation of configurational states, explains why the quasi-elastic scattering from fragile liquids is so much stronger near and above Tg than in the case of strong liquids, and why the normal glass transition can be detected in picosecond time scale experiments. Interactions among the `excitations', or `defects', are taken into account using the one component system equivalent of the binary system `regular solution' model (which keeps only the first order term of the free energy of mixing expansion). We show that a liquid-liquid first order transition must occur at sufficiently strong defect-defect interactions. The highly overconstrained amorphous silicon quasilattice is a strong candidate for such a transition. We identify the `first order melting' of amorphous silicon, and the sudden, reproducible, termination of supercooling in experimental liquid silicon and germanium, with the phase transition predicted by the model. Many more cases of this phase transition may be anticipated, and a corresponding range of glasses with low residual entropies - approaching the `perfect' glass state - are predicted.},

For a test case of soft-core Brownian particles the theory yields results for the van Hove function that agree quantitatively with those of our Brownian dynamics computer simulations. At sufficiently high densities the free energy landscape underlying the dynamics exhibits a barrier as a function of the mean particle displacement, shedding new light on the nature of glass formation. For hard spheres confined between parallel planar walls the barrier height oscillates in phase with the local density, implying that the mobility is maximal between layers, which should be experimentally observable in confined colloidal dispersions.},

@article{Clusel2009Granocentric,
    abstract = {Packing problems are ubiquitous, ranging from oil extraction through porous rocks to grain storage in silos and the compaction of pharmaceutical powders into tablets. At a given density, particulate systems pack into a mechanically stable and amorphous jammed state. Previous theoretical studies have explored a connection between this jammed state and the glass transition, the thermodynamics of jamming and geometric modelling of random packings. Nevertheless, a simple underlying mechanism for the random assembly of athermal particles, analogous to crystalline ordering, remains unknown. Here we use three-dimensional measurements of packings of polydisperse emulsion droplets to build a simple statistical model in which the complexity of the global packing is distilled into a local stochastic process. From the perspective of a single particle, the packing problem is reduced to the random formation of nearest neighbours, followed by a choice of contacts among them. The two key parameters in the modelthe available space around a particle and the ratio of contacts to neighboursare directly obtained from experiments. We demonstrate that this granocentric view captures the properties of the polydisperse emulsion packingranging from the microscopic distributions of nearest neighbours and contacts, to local density fluctuations, to the global packing density. Application of our results to monodisperse and bidisperse systems produces quantitative agreement with previously measured trends in global density. Our model therefore reveals a general principle of organization for random packing and may provide the foundations for a theory of jammed matter.},

    abstract = {We studied the structures formed in aqueous dispersions of charged colloidal spheres under a constant low salt concentration of c = 6 × 10[?]6 mol l[?]1. Particles of diameter 2a = 1000 nm were confined to a low angle wedge geometry with plate separation {0<S}<50 µm and observed with video microscopy. Irrespective of the initial particle density n we reproducibly observe the particles to migrate to the narrow wedge side on the timescale of a few days. Thereby an interface between a crystalline structure and a near particle free region is formed, which propagates slowly until the dilute region is exhausted of particles. While the origin of this separation is still unclear, the final extension of the crystalline region is stable on the timescale of months. Within the crystal phase we observe a characteristic sequence of structures with increasing plate separation similar to that seen in previous experiments on hard sphere-like systems but here with non-touching particles. Moreover, we find that mechanical equilibrium is a necessary prerequisite for observing the full richness of different phases. A detailed comparison to recent theoretical calculations for bilayers was performed and semi-quantitative agreement with the predictions observed.},

The same methodology was then used to nucleate an oriented single fcc crystal more than 30 layers thick. The general approach provides a new route for directed self-assembly of novel mesoscopic structures.},

The immobile particles form the cores of relatively compact clusters; while the mobile particles move cooperatively and form quasi-one-dimensional; stringlike clusters. The strength and length scale of the correlations between mobile particles are found to grow strongly with decreasing temperature; and the mean cluster size appears to diverge near the mode-coupling critical temperature.

The onset of the glassy phase is characterized by rapidly increasing relaxation times. These manifest themselves through changes in the diffusion constant and in the response to shear. The viscosity exhibits the same power-law scaling with shear rate that was observed in recent experiments. Our study suggests that this response is a universal property of lubricants near a glass transition.},

Additional complexity arising from the heterogeneity of local environments in biological media, and the presence of nonspecific interactions between macromolecules over and above steric repulsion, are discussed. Theoretical and experimental approaches to the characterization of crowding- and confinement-induced effects in systems approaching the complexity of living organisms are suggested.

We find an apparent violation of the {Einstein-Smoluchowski} ({ES}) relation  D = k B T μ  ( D : diffusion constant;  μ : mobility;  k B ; Boltzmann's constant;  T : temperature). The violation is a direct consequence of the fact that it is difficult for a driven particle to enter a jammed region with high order due to its yield stress. The degree of this apparent {ES} violation is controlled solely by the characteristic size of slow jammed regions,  ξ . Our finding implies that the characteristic time of this problem is not the structural relaxation time  τ α  but the lifetime of dynamic heterogeneity,  τ ξ . A supercooled liquid can be regarded to be ergodic only over  τ ξ , which may be the slowest intrinsic time scale of the system.},

In these systems, at low colloid densities, colloidal clusters are stable. Upon increasing the density by centrifugation, at different stages of cluster formation, we show that colloidal gels are formed that significantly differ in structure. While significant single-particle displacements do not occur on the hour time scale, the different gels slowly evolve within several weeks to a similar structure that is at least stable for over a year. Furthermore, while reference systems without long-range repulsion collapse into dense glassy states, the repulsive colloidal gels are able to support external stress in the form of a centrifugal field of at least 9g.},

We develop quantitative descriptions of the topology of the gel, including the number of bonds per particle, the chemical or bond fractal dimension, the number of flexible pivot points and other topological parameters that describe the chainlike structure. We investigate the dependence of these parameters on the particle volume fraction and the strength of the attraction that holds the particles together. While all samples have approximately the same fractal and chemical dimensions, we find that gels formed with stronger attraction or larger volume fraction have fewer bonds per particle, more filamentous chains and a greater number of flexible pivot points. Finally, we discuss the topological results in the context of the gel's elasticity. Measurements of the elastic constants of individual chainlike segments are explained with a simple model. The distribution of elastic constants, however, has a general form that is not understood.},

@article{Dibble2006Structure,
    abstract = {Transitions in structural heterogeneity of colloidal depletion gels formed through short-range attractive interactions are correlated with their dynamical arrest. The system is a density and refractive index matched suspension of 0.20 volume fraction poly(methyl methacyrlate) colloids with the nonadsorbing depletant polystyrene added at a size ratio of depletant to colloid of 0.043. As the strength of the short-range attractive interaction is increased, clusters become increasingly structurally heterogeneous, as characterized by number-density fluctuations, and dynamically immobilized, as characterized by the single-particle mean-squared displacement. The number of free colloids in the suspension also progressively declines. As an immobile cluster to gel transition is traversed, structural heterogeneity abruptly decreases. Simultaneously, the mean single-particle dynamics saturates at a localization length on the order of the short-range attractive potential range. Both immobile cluster and gel regimes show dynamical heterogeneity. {Non-Gaussian} distributions of single particle displacements reveal enhanced populations of dynamical trajectories localized on two different length scales. Similar dependencies of number density fluctuations, free particle number, and dynamical length scales on the order of the range of short-range attraction suggests a collective structural origin of dynamic heterogeneity in colloidal gels.},

Aqueous dispersions of charge-stabilized polystyrene spheres were studied in the hard-sphere limit, with sphere-diameter ratios ranging from 2 to 12 and total volume fractions less than 0.4. At sufficiently high volume fractions, the samples separated into two phases. One phase, consisting primarily of small spheres, is a disordered fluid. In the other phase, the large spheres form an ordered crystalline solid which is permeated by a disordered fluid of small spheres. Previously reported crystallites on the surface of the sample cell were demonstrated to have the same structure as the bulk crystals and are assumed to be a wetting of the bulk phase. A simple model of the bulk phases is described and free energies calculated. The predicted phase diagrams agree closely with the results of computer simulations and with our experimental results.},

We address this question in section 3, reviewing the latest relevant literature.

Single-particle tracking was used to measure the diffusion in aqueous suspension of dilute colloidal clusters, 2–9  µm in size, fabricated by joining 1.57  µm spheres into planar arrangements of various particle numbers and symmetries (doublet, trimer, square, pentamer, hexamer, and so forth). They were allowed to sediment close to a glass surface and their Brownian motion parallel to the surface, effectively in a two dimensional ({2D}) geometry, was imaged in a microscope in the presence of 3 {mM} monovalent salt to essentially screen electrostatic interactions. Geometric asymmetry produced systematically increasing discrepancy between the equivalent hydrodynamic radius of translation and rotation—tabulated in this paper. Our observations include cases where the effective hydrodynamic radius changes more rapidly for translation than rotation, the converse, and also cases where the effective hydrodynamic radius for translation changes significantly, while that of rotation is effectively constant. The significance is to document the connection between translational and rotational {2D} mobilities for geometrical shapes not described by the {Stokes–Einstein}–Debye equations for spherical particles.},

@article{Yatsenko2008Glassy,
    abstract = {A nonlinear Langevin equation ({NLE}) theory for the translational center-of-mass dynamics of hard nonspherical objects has been applied to isotropic fluids of rigid rods. The ideal kinetic glass transition volume fraction is predicted to be a monotonically decreasing function beyond an aspect ratio of two. The functional form of the decrease is weaker than the inverse aspect ratio. Vitrification occurs at lower volume fractions for corrugated tangent bead rods compared to their smooth spherocylinder analogs. The ideal glass transition signals a crossover to activated dynamics, which is estimated to be observable before the nematic phase boundary is encountered if the aspect ratio is less than roughly 25. Calculations of the glassy elastic shear modulus and absolute yield stress reveal a roughly exponential growth with volume fraction. The dependence of entropic barriers and mean barrier hopping times on concentration for rods of variable aspect ratios can be collapsed quite well based on a difference volume fraction variable that quantifies the distance from the ideal glass boundary. Full numerical solution of the {NLE} theory via stochastic trajectory simulation was performed for tangent bead rods, and the results were compared to their hard sphere analogs. With increasing shape anisotropy the characteristic length scales of the nonequilibrium free energy increase and the magnitude of the localization well and entropic barrier curvatures decreases. These changes result in a significant aspect ratio dependence of dynamical properties and time correlation functions including weaker intermediate time subdiffusive transport, stronger two-step decay of the incoherent dynamic structure factor, longer mean alpha relaxation time, and stronger wavevector-dependent decoupling of relaxation times and the self-diffusion constant. The theoretical results are potentially testable via computer simulation, confocal microscopy, and dynamic light scattering.},

    abstract = {{Stokes-Einstein} ({SE}) and {Stokes-Einstein}-Debye ({SED}) relations in the neat ionic liquid ({IL}) [{C2mim][NTf2}] and {IL}/chloroform mixtures are studied by means of molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations. For this purpose, we simulate the translational diffusion coefficients of the cations and anions, the rotational correlation times of the {C(2)\&bond;H} bond in the cation C2mim+, and the viscosities of the whole system. We find that the {SE} and {SED} relations are not valid for the pure ionic liquid, nor for {IL}/chloroform mixtures down to the miscibility gap (at 50 wt \% {IL}). The deviations from both relations could be related to dynamical heterogeneities described by the {non-Gaussian} parameter alpha(t).

    comment = {This paper is about a simulation of ionic liquids.  They show a similarity between ionic liquids and liquid water.  They also find a breakdown of both the SE and DSE equations, and say that this "could be related to dynamical heterogeneities" but their only evidence of these heterogeneities is only through the non-Gaussian parameter.  They do not do anything close to what Mazza or Lombardo did.  However, they do focus on the system's viscosity more than the other papers.

In short, this article is specifically looking at ionic liquids and says that they behave similarly to water, and that's about it.

Personally, I don't think this article has anything that new or interesting.  They just do the standard routine of measuring the non-Gaussian parameters in order to show that dynamical heterogeneities exist, and then conclude that this is why the viscosity of the system doesn't match up with the DSE and SE equations.},

@article{Palomar2007Dynamic,
    abstract = {Dynamic heterogeneities in a supercooled system of diatomic molecules
with an associated dipole moment have been investigated. To this end,
three-time correlation functions have been evaluated. Correlations
between molecular displacements performed during consecutive time
intervals are apparent at low temperatures in the  beta -relaxation
regime, whereas they tend to disappear during the  alpha -relaxation
regime. These correlations maximize when the deviation from Gaussian
dynamics takes a maximum, and they reveal the existence of different
dynamic domains. Directionality of translational motions has also been
studied. At low temperatures, and in the  beta -relaxation zone, the
molecular vector displacement in a given time interval has an important
component in the opposite direction of the vector displacement
corresponding to the initial time interval. The amplitudes associated
with this quasi-oscillatory behavior become larger as the system is
cooled. Dynamic heterogeneities in reorientation have been observed in
the  beta -relaxation regime, and it has been obtained that molecules
that perform faster translational motions experience faster
reorientational motions too. This effect increases as temperature
decreases.},

relaxation time versus scaled inverse temperature plot and demonstrate
that one can indeed define a ``fragility index'' for

The values of the fragility parameter are surprisingly in the range
observed for glass-forming liquids. A plausible correlation between the
energy landscape features and the observed fragility is discussed.},

The large angular jumps are intimately related to meta-basin transitions in the potential energy landscape of the investigated system and cause the appearance of stretched exponential relaxations of various rotational observables, reported in the {SM} literature as dynamic heterogeneity.

@article{Vallee2007Single,
    abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of a system of short bead-spring chains containing an additional dumbbell are presented and analyzed. This system represents a coarse-grained model for a melt of short, flexible polymers containing fluorescent probe molecules at very dilute concentration. It is shown that such a system is very well suited to study aspects of the glass transition of the undercooled polymer melt via single molecule spectroscopy, which are not easily accessed by other methods. Such aspects include data which can be extracted from a study of fluctuations along a trajectory of the single molecule, probing the rugged energy landscape of the glass-forming liquid and transitions from one metabasin of this energy landscape to the next one. Such an information can be inferred from "distance maps" constructed from trajectories characterizing the translational and orientational motion of the probe. At the same time, determining autocorrelation functions along such trajectories, it is shown for several types of probes (differing in their size and/or mass within reasonable limits) that this time-averaged information of the probe is fully compatible with ensemble averaged information on the relaxation of the glass-forming matrix, accessible from bulk measurements. The analyzed quantities include the fluorescence lifetime, linear dichroism, and also various orientational correlation functions of the probe, in order to provide guidance to experimental work. Similar to earlier findings from simulations of bulk molecular fluids, deviations from the {Stokes-Einstein} and {Stokes-Einstein}-Debye relations are observed.},

Our very lowest frequency modes show "quasi-localized" resonances away from the jamming point; the spatial extent of these regions increases as the jamming point is approached, as expected theoretically. Throughout the remaining frequency range, our data show no signature of the nearness of the jamming point and collapse well when properly rescaled with the system size.

In particular, long-lived (energetically) locally favoured structures ({LFSs}), the geometry of which may prevent the system relaxing to its equilibrium state, have long been thought to play a key role in dynamical arrest. Here, we propose a definition of {LFSs} which we identify with a novel topological method and directly measure with experiments on a colloidal liquid–gel transition. The population of {LFSs} is a strong function of (effective) temperature in the ergodic liquid phase, rising sharply approaching dynamical arrest, and indeed forms a percolating network that becomes the 'arms' of the gel. Owing to the {LFSs}, the gel is unable to reach equilibrium, crystal–gas coexistence. Our results provide direct experimental observation of a link between local structure and dynamical arrest, and open a new perspective on a wide range of metastable materials.},

From the liquid perspective, the puzzle is to understand stress relaxation in the disordered state. From the perspective of solids, the challenge is to extend our description of structure and its mechanical consequences to materials without long-range order. Using computer simulations, we show that the localized low-frequency normal modes of a configuration in a supercooled liquid are causally correlated to the irreversible structural reorganization of the particles within this configuration. We also demonstrate that the spatial distribution of these soft local modes can persist in spite of significant particle reorganization. The consequence of these two results is that it is now feasible to construct a theory of relaxation length scales in glass-forming liquids without recourse to dynamics and to explicitly relate molecular properties to their collective relaxation.},

The latter are macromolecular entities with typical sizes ranging from 1 nm to and their suspension typically contain, in addition to the solvent, smaller components such as salt ions or free polymer chains. The theoretical tool introduced is the effective Hamiltonian which formally results by a canonical trace over the smaller degrees of freedom for a fixed,  ” frozen” configuration of the large ones. After presenting the formal definitions of this effective Hamiltonian, we proceed with the applications to some common soft matter systems having a variable softness and ranging from free polymer chains to hard colloidal particles. We begin from the extreme case of nondiverging effective interactions between ultrasoft polymer chains and derive an exact criterion to determine the topology of the phase diagrams of such systems. We use star polymers with a variable arm number f as a hybrid system in order to interpolate between these two extremes. By deriving an effective interaction between stars we can monitor the change in the phase behavior of a system as the steepness of the repulsion between its constituent particles increases. We also review recent results on the nature and the effects of short-range attractions on the phase diagrams of spherical, nonoverlapping colloidal particles.},

@article{Bryngelson1995Funnels,
    abstract = {The understanding, and even the description of protein folding is impeded by the complexity of the process. Much of this complexity can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to uniexponential vs. multiexponential behavior in protein folding experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different thermodynamic conditions. {\copyright} 1995 {Wiley-Liss}, Inc.},

    abstract = {The rate of growth of chain-folded lamellar crystals from the subcooled melt of polyethylene fractions is treated in terms of surface nucleation theory with the objective of illuminating the origin of the chain folding phenomenon and associated kinetic effects in molecular terms. An updated version of flux-based nucleation theory in readily usable form is outlined that deals with the nature of polymer chains in more detail than previous treatments. The subjects covered include: (i) the origin of regimes I, {II}, {III}, and {III}-A and the associated crystal growth rates, including the effect of forced steady-state reptation and reptation of 'slack' in the subcooled melt; (ii) the variation of the initial lamellar thickness with undercooling; (iii) the origin of the fold surface free energy σe and the lateral surface free energy σ; (iv) the generation and effect of nonadjacent events (such as tie chains) on the crystallinity and growth rates; and (v) 'quantized' chain folding at low molecular weight. The topological limitation on nonadjacent re-entry and the value of the apportionment factor ψ are discussed. Key experimental data are analysed in terms of the theory and essential parameters determined, including the size of the substrate length L involved in regime I growth. The degree of adjacent and/or 'tight' folding that obtains in the kinetically-induced lamellar structures is treated as being a function of molecular weight and undercooling. New evidence based on the quantization effect indicates a high degree of adjacent re-entry in regime I for the lower molecular weight fractions. The quality of the chain folding at higher molecular weights in the various regimes is discussed in terms of kinetic, neutron scattering, i.r., and other evidence. Application of the theory to other polymers is discussed briefly.},

@article{Flory1949Configuration,
    abstract = {The average configuration of polymer molecules in solution is markedly influenced by the obvious requirement, ordinarily disregarded in problems relating to molecular configuration, that two elements of the molecule are forbidden from occupying the same location in space. The influence of spatial ``interferences'' between different segments of the molecule on its average configuration has been investigated by statistical and thermodynamic {methods.It} is shown that if the average linear dimension of a polymer chain is to be taken proportional to a power of the chain length, that power must be greater than the value 0.50 previously deduced in the conventional ``random flight'' treatment of molecular configuration. This power should approach 0.60 for long chain molecules in good solvents. With increase in size of the solvent molecule, the influence of interference on molecular configuration diminishes, vanishing entirely in the extreme case of a solvent which is also a high polymer. The effect of a heat of interaction between solvent and polymer may also be incorporated quantitatively in the theory. A positive heat of mixing (poor solvent) tends to offset the expansive influence of interference, and the exponent referred to above tends to approach 0.50. The results are of foremost significance in the interpretation of the intrinsic viscosity and its dependence on the polymer constitution and on the solvent. It is pointed out that the spatial dimensions of the irregularly coiled polymer molecule cannot be correlated directly with hindrance to rotation about chain bonds, unless the expansion of the configuration due to interference and the effects of the heat of dilution are first of all taken into account.},

The proteins attached covalently to the slide surface yet retained their ability to interact specifically with other proteins, or with small molecules, in solution.

@article{Lu2008Gelation,
    abstract = {Nanoscale or colloidal particles are important in many realms of science and technology. They can dramatically change the properties of materials, imparting solid-like behaviour to a wide variety of complex fluids1, 2. This behaviour arises when particles aggregate to form mesoscopic clusters and networks. The essential component leading to aggregation is an interparticle attraction, which can be generated by many physical and chemical mechanisms. In the limit of irreversible aggregation, infinitely strong interparticle bonds lead to diffusion-limited cluster aggregation3 ({DLCA}). This is understood as a purely kinetic phenomenon that can form solid-like gels at arbitrarily low particle volume fraction4, 5. Far more important technologically are systems with weaker attractions, where gel formation requires higher volume fractions. Numerous scenarios for gelation have been proposed, including {DLCA6}, kinetic or dynamic arrest4, 7, 8, 9, 10, phase separation5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, percolation4, 12, 17, 18 and jamming8. No consensus has emerged and, despite its ubiquity and significance, gelation is far from understood—even the location of the gelation phase boundary is not agreed on5. Here we report experiments showing that gelation of spherical particles with isotropic, short-range attractions is initiated by spinodal decomposition; this thermodynamic instability triggers the formation of density fluctuations, leading to spanning clusters that dynamically arrest to create a gel. This simple picture of gelation does not depend on microscopic system-specific details, and should thus apply broadly to any particle system with short-range attractions. Our results suggest that gelation—often considered a purely kinetic phenomenon4, 8, 9, 10—is in fact a direct consequence of equilibrium liquid–gas phase separation5, 13, 14, 15. Without exception, we observe gelation in all of our samples predicted by theory and simulation to phase-separate; this suggests that it is phase separation, not percolation12, that corresponds to gelation in models for attractive spheres.},

For moderate Coulomb coupling, we find that this force is repulsive. Under strong-coupling conditions, however, the sign of the force depends on the distance to the plates and on the interparticle distance. In particular, the particle-plate interaction becomes strongly attractive for small distances which may explain the occurrence of colloidal crystalline layers near the plates observed in recent experiments.},

@article{Scheidler2002Growing,
    abstract = {We present the results of molecular dynamics computer simulations of a simple glass former close to an interface between the liquid and the frozen amorphous phase of the same material. By investigating Fs(q, z, t), the incoherent intermediate scattering function for particles that have a distance z from the wall, we show that the relaxation dynamics of the particles close to the wall are much slower than those for particles far away from the wall. For small z the typical relaxation time for Fs(q, z, t) increases as exp[(z-zp)], where and zp are constants. We use the location of the crossover from this law to the bulk behaviour to define a first length scale z. A different length scale is defined by considering the Ansatz Fs(q, z, t) = Fs\bulk(q, t) + a(t) exp-[z/(t)](t), where a(t), (t) and (t) are fit parameters. We show that this Ansatz gives a very good description of the data for all times and all values of z. The length (t) increases for short and intermediate times and decreases again on the time scale of the relaxation of the system. The maximum value of (t) can thus be defined as a new length scale max. We find that z as well as max increase with decreasing temperature. The temperature dependence of this increase is compatible with a divergence of the length scale at the Kauzmann temperature of the bulk system.},

We show that these result from the strong flow from menisci in large pores to menisci in small pores during drying. This flow causes air invasions to start in large menisci and subsequently spread throughout the entire system. We measure the size and structure of the air invasions and show that they are in accord with invasion percolation. By varying the particle size and contact angle we unambiguously demonstrate that capillary pressure dominates the drying process.},

@article{Alcoutlabi2005Effects,
    abstract = {In this article, the effects of size and confinement at the nanometre size scale on both the melting temperature, Tm, and the glass transition temperature, Tg, are reviewed. Although there is an accepted thermodynamic model (the {Gibbs–Thomson} equation) for explaining the shift in the first-order transition, Tm, for confined materials, the depression of the melting point is still not fully understood and clearly requires further investigation. However, the main thrust of the work is a review of the field of confinement and size effects on the glass transition temperature. We present in detail the dynamic, thermodynamic and pseudo-thermodynamic measurements reported for the glass transition in confined geometries for both small molecules confined in nanopores and for ultrathin polymer films. We survey the observations that show that the glass transition temperature decreases, increases, remains the same or even disappears depending upon details of the experimental (or molecular simulation) conditions. Indeed, different behaviours have been observed for the same material depending on the experimental methods used. It seems that the existing theories of Tg are unable to explain the range of behaviours seen at the nanometre size scale, in part because the glass transition phenomenon itself is not fully understood. Importantly, here we conclude that the vast majority of the experiments have been carried out carefully and the results are reproducible. What is currently lacking appears to be an overall view, which accounts for the range of observations. The field seems to be experimentally and empirically driven rather than responding to major theoretical developments.},

@article{Deegan1997Capillary,
    abstract = {When a spilled drop of coffee dries on a solid surface, it leaves a dense, ring-like deposit along the perimeter (Fig. 1a). The coffee—initially dispersed over the entire drop—becomes concentrated into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they influence processes such as printing, washing and coating1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Ring deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine pattern onto a surface. Here we ascribe the characteristic pattern of the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the edge. This mechanism predicts a distinctive power-law growth of the ring mass with time—a law independent of the particular substrate, carrier fluid or deposited solids. We have verified this law by microscopic observations of colloidal fluids.},

@article{Ballesta2008Unexpected,
    abstract = {Abstract: In supercooled molecular fluids or concentrated colloids and grains, the dynamics slow down markedly with no distinct structural changes as the glass(1) or the jamming(2) transition is approached. There is now ample evidence that structural relaxation in glassy systems can only occur through correlated rearrangements of particle `blobs' of size xi (refs 3-7), leading to dynamics that are heterogeneous both in time and in space. On approaching these transitions, xi grows in glass-formers(6-8), colloids(3,4,9) and driven granular materials(10) alike, strengthening the analogies between the glass and the jamming transitions and providing a possible explanation for the slowing down of the dynamics. However, little is known yet on the behaviour of dynamical heterogeneity very close to dynamical arrest. Here, we measure in colloids the maximum of a 'dynamical susceptibility', chi*, that quantifies the temporal fluctuations of the dynamics, the growth of which is usually associated with that of xi (ref. 11). We find that chi* initially increases with particle volume fraction, but drops markedly very close to jamming. We show that this behaviour results from the competition between the growth of xi and the reduced particle displacements associated with rearrangements in very dense suspensions, unveiling a richer-than-expected scenario.},

@article{Leunissen2005Ionic,
    abstract = {Colloidal suspensions are widely used to study processes such as melting, freezing1, 2, 3 and glass transitions4, 5. This is because they display the same phase behaviour as atoms or molecules, with the nano- to micrometre size of the colloidal particles making it possible to observe them directly in real space3, 4. Another attractive feature is that different types of colloidal interactions, such as long-range repulsive1, 3, short-range attractive5, hard-sphere-like2, 3, 4 and dipolar3, can be realized and give rise to equilibrium phases. However, spherically symmetric, long-range attractions (that is, ionic interactions) have so far always resulted in irreversible colloidal aggregation6. Here we show that the electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged particles can be tuned such that large ionic colloidal crystals form readily, with our theory and simulations confirming the stability of these structures. We find that in contrast to atomic systems, the stoichiometry of our colloidal crystals is not dictated by charge neutrality; this allows us to obtain a remarkable diversity of new binary structures. An external electric field melts the crystals, confirming that the constituent particles are indeed oppositely charged. Colloidal model systems can thus be used to study the phase behaviour of ionic species. We also expect that our approach to controlling opposite-charge interactions will facilitate the production of binary crystals of micrometre-sized particles, which could find use as advanced materials for photonic applications7.},

In this new model system Debye screening lengths (k[?]1) comparable to the particle size (diameter s) can be realized even for particles with sizes of several micrometres. Moreover, by addition of salt (tetrabutylammonium chloride) k[?]1 can be varied and the surface charge of the particles can be set roughly in between the values +100 and [?]100 {mV}, as determined by electrophoresis. By a comparison of radial distribution functions and displacements from lattice positions with Monte Carlo computer simulations we found that both the structure in the liquid and the crystallization volume fraction could be described with a Yukawa potential characterized by one set of parameters, a surface potential of 36 {mV} and ks = 5, where the particle diameter s = 2 um . Anomalous ('phase') behaviour such as extreme long-range repulsions, 'coexistence' of high-density and low-density colloidal crystals and void formation, previously observed for deionized dispersions in water, was observed as well, and can now be studied in a different system without ion exchange resin. These anomalous effects are seen relatively soon after preparing the systems and are absent or short-lived in systems with grounding and at higher salt concentrations.},

@article{Ngai1999Similarity,
    abstract = {Dielectric relaxation and dynamic light scattering of small molecule glass-forming liquids invariably show that the fractional exponent βα of the {Kohlrausch-Williams}-Watts correlation function, exp[-(t/τα)βα], used to fit the α-relaxation data is temperature dependent, increasing towards the value of unity as temperature is raised and the relaxation time τ decreased. Comparing different glass formers, another property is the existence of a correlation between the value of (1-βα) at the glass temperature, Tg, and the Tg-scaled temperature dependence of τα. We analyze a system of interacting arrays of globally coupled nonlinear oscillators. Each array has its oscillators coupled among themselves with a coupling strength K. The coupling between arrays is characterized by the interarray coupling strength K′. The decay of the phase coherence r for each array is slowed down by the interarray coupling and its time dependence is well approximated at sufficiently long times by exp[-(t/τ)β]. For a fixed K′, on increasing K the results exhibit a decrease of τ and a concomitant increase of β, similar to the properties of dielectric relaxation and dynamic light scattering of glass-forming liquids on increasing temperature. For each K′ we define Kg to be the value of K at which τ is equal to an arbitrarily chosen long time. We find that {β(Kg}) is correlated with the Kg-scaled K dependence of τ. The results obtained in this manner at various fixed values of K′ reproduce the relaxation properties and temperature dependencies of strong, intermediate, and fragile glass-forming liquids.},

    abstract = {Amorphous glassy materials of diverse nature—concentrated emulsions, granular materials, pastes, molecular glasses—display complex flow properties, intermediate between solid and liquid, which are at the root of their use in many applications1, 2, 3. A general feature of such systems, well documented yet not really understood, is the strongly nonlinear nature of the flow rule relating stresses and strain rates4, 5. Here we use a microfluidic velocimetry technique to characterize the flow of thin layers of concentrated emulsions, confined in gaps of different thicknesses by surfaces of different roughnesses. We find evidence for finite-size effects in the flow behaviour and the absence of an intrinsic local flow rule. In contrast to the classical nonlinearities of the rheological behaviour of amorphous materials, we show that a rather simple non-local flow rule can account for all the velocity profiles. This non-locality of the dynamics is quantified by a length, characteristic of cooperativity within the flow at these scales, that is unobservable in the liquid state (lower emulsion concentrations) and that increases with concentration in the jammed state. Beyond its practical importance for applications involving thin layers (for example, coatings), these non-locality and cooperativity effects have parallels in the behaviour of other glassy, jammed and granular systems, suggesting a possible fundamental universality.},

@article{Ngai2002Relaxation,
    abstract = {Two recent experiments have shown dramatic changes in molecular dynamics when the size of the glass formers is reduced to the nanometre scale but in opposite directions. The first is a dielectric relaxation study by Anastasiadis et al. of the local segmental relaxation in 1.5-2.0 nm poly(methyl phenyl siloxane) ({PMPS}) films confined between parallel solid surfaces of silicate nanocomposites. The relaxation was observed to be much faster and had a significantly weaker temperature dependence compared to the bulk polymer. The other experiment is a molecular dynamics computer simulation by Scheidler et al. of a binary {LennardJones} liquid confined either in a cylindrical pore or as a thin film confined between two walls. In the simulation, the walls were made of an amorphous structure similar to that of the confined liquid but the particles in the walls were fixed in position. The mobile particles inside the pore or in the thin film interact with each other and with the wall particles by the same potential. Scheidler et al. found the relaxation rates of particles in the pore or the film are slowed down and the degree of slowing down increases rapidly with decreasing distance between the particle and the wall. In this work, the coupling model is used to explain quantitatively the large changes in relaxation rates in the {PMPS} films and in the confined binary {Lennard-Jones} liquid, and why they go in opposite directions. Further, the observed effects in these two cases are shown to have analogues in the dynamics of probe molecules introduced in dilute quantity to glass-forming hosts and the component dynamics of miscible blends of two glass formers.},

@article{Roth2007Eliminating,
    abstract = {By selective placement of fluorescent dyes, we have measured the glass transition temperature (Tg) of individual layers within supported bilayer films of different polymers to determine the extent to which strong free-surface effects and substrate interactions are mediated by a narrow interface between immiscible polymers. We have discovered that the impact a free surface has on Tg within an ultrathin {PS} layer is extremely sensitive to the polymer species used in the underlayer. The large Tg reduction of ?32 K relative to bulk Tg observed for a 14 nm thick surface layer of polystyrene ({PS}) supported on bulk {PS} is virtually eliminated when a 14 nm thick surface layer of {PS} is placed on an underlayer of poly(methyl methacrylate) or poly(2-vinylpyridine) ({P2VP}), even of bulk thickness. Thus, the cooperative segmental mobility associated with the Tg of the {PS} free-surface layer is greatly hindered by the narrow, several-nanometer-wide interfacial region formed with the dissimilar polymer underlayer. This indicates that the dynamics of nanoscale layers can be strongly modified by adjacent layers or domains of unlike polymers via propagation of effects across an interfacial layer of cooperatively rearranging regions containing segments of the two immiscible polymers, which has important implications for multilayer films and nanostructured blends. Conversely, the Tg of an ultrathin {P2VP} film is unaffected by the presence of a {PS} capping layer, indicating that strong attractive interactions of {P2VP} with hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica substrate dominate over a much weaker free-surface effect in {P2VP}. By selective placement of fluorescent dyes, we have measured the glass transition temperature (Tg) of individual layers within supported bilayer films of different polymers to determine the extent to which strong free-surface effects and substrate interactions are mediated by a narrow interface between immiscible polymers. We have discovered that the impact a free surface has on Tg within an ultrathin {PS} layer is extremely sensitive to the polymer species used in the underlayer. The large Tg reduction of ?32 K relative to bulk Tg observed for a 14 nm thick surface layer of polystyrene ({PS}) supported on bulk {PS} is virtually eliminated when a 14 nm thick surface layer of {PS} is placed on an underlayer of poly(methyl methacrylate) or poly(2-vinylpyridine) ({P2VP}), even of bulk thickness. Thus, the cooperative segmental mobility associated with the Tg of the {PS} free-surface layer is greatly hindered by the narrow, several-nanometer-wide interfacial region formed with the dissimilar polymer underlayer. This indicates that the dynamics of nanoscale layers can be strongly modified by adjacent layers or domains of unlike polymers via propagation of effects across an interfacial layer of cooperatively rearranging regions containing segments of the two immiscible polymers, which has important implications for multilayer films and nanostructured blends. Conversely, the Tg of an ultrathin {P2VP} film is unaffected by the presence of a {PS} capping layer, indicating that strong attractive interactions of {P2VP} with hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica substrate dominate over a much weaker free-surface effect in {P2VP}.},

@article{Shintani2006Frustration,
    abstract = {Some liquids do not crystallize below the melting point, but instead enter into a supercooled state and on cooling eventually become a glass at the glass-transition temperature. During this process, the liquid dynamics not only drastically slow down, but also become progressively more heterogeneous. The relationship between the kinetic slowing down and growing dynamic heterogeneity is a key problem of the liquid–glass transition. Here, we study this problem by using a liquid model, with a crystalline ground state, for which we can systematically control frustration against crystallization. We found that slow regions having a high degree of crystalline order emerge below the melting point, and their characteristic size and lifetime increase steeply on cooling. These crystalline regions lead to dynamic heterogeneity, suggesting a connection to the complex free-energy landscape and the resulting slow dynamics. These findings point towards an intrinsic link between the glass transition and crystallization.},

We show using computer simulations that two structures that would enable a bandgap in the visible region, diamond and pyrochlore, can be self-assembled in one crystal structure from a binary colloidal dispersion. In our approach, these two structures are obtained as the large (Mg) and small (Cu) sphere components of the colloidal analogue of the {MgCu2} Laves phase2, whose growth can be selected and directed using appropriate wall patterning. The method requires that the particles consist of different materials, so that one of them can be removed selectively after drying (for example, by burning or dissolution). Photonic calculations show that gaps appear at relatively low frequencies indicating that they are robust and open for modest contrast, enabling fabrication from more materials.},

@article{Stevenson2006Shapes,
    abstract = {The cooperative rearrangement of groups of many
molecules has long been thought to underlie the dramatic
slowing of liquid dynamics on cooling towards the glassy
state. For instance, there exists experimental evidence
for cooperatively rearranging regions ({CRRs}) on the
nanometre length scale near the glass transition. The
random first-order transition ({RFOT}) theory of glasses
predicts that, near the glass-transition temperature, these
regions are compact, but computer simulations and
experiments on colloids suggest {CRRs} are string-like.
Here, we present a microscopic theory within the
framework of {RFOT}, which unites the two situations.
We show that the shapes of {CRRs} in glassy liquids
should change from being compact at low temperatures
to fractal or 'stringy' as the dynamical crossover
temperature from activated to collisional transport is
approached from below. This theory predicts a correlation
of the ratio of the dynamical crossover temperature
to the laboratory glass-transition temperature, and
the heat-capacity discontinuity at the glass transition.
The predicted correlation quantitatively agrees with
experimental results for 21 materials.},

@article{Zhou2006Measurement,
    abstract = {We present systematic and detailed measurements of interparticle contact forces inside three-dimensional piles of frictionless liquid droplets. We measured long-range chainlike correlations of the directions and magnitudes of large forces, thereby establishing the presence of force chains in three dimensions. Our correlation definition provides a chain persistence length of 10 mean droplet diameters, decreasing as load is applied to the pile. We also measured the angles between contacts and showed that the chainlike arrangement arises from the balance of forces. Moreover, we found that piles whose height was comparable to the chain persistence length exhibited substantially greater strain hardening than did tall piles, which we attributed to the force chains. Together, the results establish a connection between the microscopic force network and the elastic response of meso- or macroscopic granular piles. The conclusions drawn here should be relevant in jammed systems generally, including concentrated emulsions and piles of sand or other heavy particles.},

The colloids are poly(methyl methacrylate) ({PMMA}) spheres sterically stabilized by a copolymer of poly(diphenyl–dimethyl) ({DPDM}) siloxane that matches the refractive index of {PMMA}. The monodisperse particles, synthesized with mean diameter varying from 0.7 to 1.1 \^{I}¼m, are stably dispersed in a {DPDM} siloxane solvent, with viscosity varying from 2.2 to 4.3 Pa s at 20 °C. As opposed to other classes of {PMMA} colloids dispersed in organic solvents, this system displays minimal charge interactions. At room temperature, pair potential interactions (measured by extrapolation of pair correlation functions to infinite dilution) are well modeled by a generalized {Lennard-Jones} \^{I}±–2\^{I}± potential (\^{I}±=10) with dimensionless interaction energy, {\^{I}µ/kBT}=0.6. We use the {DPDM}–{PMMA} colloidal system in conjunction with confocal microscopy studies to measure: (i) the radial distribution function in {3D} at dilute concentrations and (ii) the colloid self-diffusivity in {3D} at dilute concentrations. Both measurements, neither previously reported in uncharged systems, are facilitated by the slow, viscous dynamics of the system. We also show that the viscosity and particle size of the system are such that the high-volume fraction shear thickening transition can be accessed at shear rates amenable to direct visualization. },

@article{Mukhija2007Translational,
    abstract = {We report an experimental method to characterize the dynamics of colloidal rods by measuring their rotation and translation in three dimensions with confocal microscopy. The method relies on solvent viscosification to retard dynamics to time scales that are compatible with {3D} confocal optical microscopy. Because the method yields a full three-dimensional characterization of rod displacement and orientation, it is applicable to situations in which complex, anisotropic dynamics emerge. Examples include behavior in liquid crystal phases with both orientational and positional order, suspensions subjected to applied fields such as shear flow or sedimentation, and the emerging area of anisotropic particle dynamics. We demonstrate the performance of the method by quantifying the Brownian motion of fluorescent poly(methyl methacrylate) rods (aspect ratio, {L/D}=3.1 and 7.0) grafted with poly(dimethylsiloxane) stabilizer. The rods are dispersed at dilute concentration in a solvent mixture of viscosity 2.0 Pa s. Rod translational and rotational diffusivities are extracted from the measured translational mean square displacement of the centroid positions and of the rod unit vector u(t), respectively. Rod orientational dynamics are characterized relative to both their azimuthal and polar angles. Probability distributions for the translation and rotation in the frame of rod are computed from the measurements. Experimental values obtained agree well with theory available for the dynamics of isolated rods. We quantify the translational and rotational diffusion of prolate spheroid colloidal rods by {3D} direct visualization of displacement and orientation by confocal microscopy. },

@article{Lee2008Optofluidics,
    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Optofluidic} technology is believed to provide a breakthrough for the currently underlying problems in microfluidics and photonics/optics by complementary integration of fluidics and photonics. The key aspect of the optofluidics technology is based on the use of fluidics for tuning the optical properties and addressing various functional materials inside of microfluidic channels which have build-in photonic structures. Through the optofluidic integrations, fluidics enhances the controllability and tunability of optical systems. In particular, colloidal dispersion gives novel properties such as photonic band-gaps and enhanced Raman spectrum that conventional optofluidic devices cannot exhibit. In this paper, the state of the art of the colloidal dispersions is reviewed especially for optofluidic applications. From isolated singlet colloidal particles to colloidal clusters, their self-organized assemblies lead to optical manipulation of the photonic/optical properties and responses. Finally, we will discuss the prospects of the integrated optofluidics technology based on colloidal systems.},

With the aid of group theory, we identify the resonances that provide the strongest electric and magnetic response and study them as a function of separation between spherical nanoparticles. It is demonstrated that a colloidal solution of plasmonic tetrahedral nanoclusters can act as an optical medium with very large, small, or even negative effective permittivity, ε eff , and substantial effective magnetic susceptibility, Χ eff  = μ eff  −1, in the visible or near infrared bands. We suggest paths for increasing the magnetic response, decreasing the damping, and developing a metafluid with simultaneously negative ε eff  and μ eff .},

@article{Herzig2007Bicontinuous,
    abstract = {Recent large-scale computer simulations suggest that it may be possible to create a new class of soft solids, called 'bijels', by stabilizing and arresting the bicontinuous interface in a binary liquid demixing via spinodal decomposition using particles that are neutrally wetted by both liquids1. The interfacial layer of particles is expected to be semi-permeable2; hence, if realized, these new materials would have many potential applications, for example, as micro-reaction media. However, the creation of bijels in the laboratory faces serious obstacles3. In general, fast quench rates are necessary to bypass nucleation, so that only samples with limited thickness can be produced, which destroys the three-dimensionality of the putative bicontinuous network. Moreover, even a small degree of unequal wettability of the particles by the two liquids can lead to ill-characterized, 'lumpy' interfacial layers and therefore irreproducible material properties3. Here, we report a reproducible protocol for creating three-dimensional samples of bijel in which the interfaces are stabilized by essentially a single layer of particles. We demonstrate how to tune the mean interfacial separation in these bijels, and show that mechanically, they indeed behave as soft solids. These characteristics and their tunability will be of great value for microfluidic applications.},

@article{Auer2001Suppression,
    abstract = {
                The formation of small crystallites is governed by two competing factors: the free energy gained upon transferring constituent atoms, molecules or colloidal particles from the metastable liquid to the more stable solid, and the free energy needed to create the surface area of the crystallite. Because the ratio of surface area to bulk is large for small particles, small crystallites dissolve spontaneously under conditions where larger crystallites are stable and macroscopic crystal growth occurs only if spontaneously formed crystallites exceed a critical minimum size. On theoretical grounds, the probability of forming such critical crystal nuclei is expected to increase rapidly with supersaturation. However, experiments show that the rate of crystal nucleation in many systems goes through a maximum as the supersaturation is increased. It is commonly assumed that the nucleation rate peaks because, even though the probability of forming critical nuclei increases with increasing concentration, the rate of growth of such nuclei decreases. Here we report simulations of crystal nucleation in suspensions of colloidal spheres with varying size distributions that show that the probability that critical nuclei will form itself goes through a maximum as the supersaturation is increased. We find that this effect, which is strongest for systems with the broadest particle size distribution, results from an increase with supersaturation of the solid-liquid interfacial free energy. The magnitude of this effect suggests that vitrification at high supersaturations should yield colloidal glasses that are truly amorphous, rather than nano-crystalline.

@article{Mittal2007Does,
    abstract = {We use grand canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo and discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations to generate precise thermodynamic and kinetic data for the equilibrium hard-sphere fluid confined between smooth hard walls. These simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the fluid normal to the confining walls, often the primary focus of density functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. We present one consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid with equal activity. Nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters. For this limited set of conditions, we find that  ” in-phase” oscillatory deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size. These paired thermodynamic/kinetic deviations from bulk behavior appear to reflect the geometric packing frustration that arises when the confined space cannot naturally accommodate an integer number of particle layers. {\copyright}2007 American Institute of Physics},

@article{Keys2007Measurement,
    abstract = {Supercooled liquids and dense colloidal suspensions exhibit anomalous behaviour known as 'spatially heterogeneous dynamics' ({SHD}), which becomes increasingly pronounced as the system approaches the glass transition1, 2, 3. Recently, the observation of {SHD} in confined granular packings under slow shear near the onset of jamming has bolstered speculation that the two transitions are related4, 5, 6. Here, we report measurements of {SHD} in a system of air-driven granular beads, as a function of both density and effective temperature. On approach to jamming, the dynamics becomes progressively slower and more spatially heterogeneous. The rapid growth of timescales and dynamical length scales characterizing the heterogeneities can be described both by mode-coupling theory7 and the {Vogel–Tammann}–Fulcher ({VTF}) equation8, such as in glass-forming liquids. The value of the control variable at the {VTF} transition coincides with point J (refs 9, 10), the random close-packed jamming density at which all motion ceases, in analogy to a zero-temperature ideal glass transition. Our findings demonstrate further universality of the jamming concept and provide a significant step forward in the quest for a unified theory of jamming in disparate systems.},

We conclusively show that the sedentary particles, i.e., ones complementary to the  ” hoppers,” obey the {SE} relationship to a good approximation, even though the fluid as a whole violates the {SE} equation at high densities.

Here the distribution of Tgs across polystyrene films has been obtained by a fluorescence/multilayer method, revealing that the enhancement of dynamics at a surface affects Tg several tens of nanometres into the film. The extent to which dynamics smoothly transition from enhanced to bulk states depends strongly on nanoconfinement. When polymer films are sufficiently thin that a reduction in thickness leads to a reduction in overall Tg, the surface-layer Tg actually increases with a reduction in overall thickness, whereas the substrate-layer Tg decreases. These results indicate that the gradient in Tg dynamics is not abrupt, and that the size of a cooperatively rearranging region is much smaller than the distance over which interfacial effects propagate.},

@article{Lacevic2004Dynamical,
    abstract = {The relationship between spatially heterogeneous dynamics ({SHD}) and jamming is studied in a glass-forming binary {Lennard-Jones} system via molecular dynamics simulations. It has been suggested [Phys. Rev. Lett. 2001, 86, 111]1 that the probability distribution of interparticle forces {P(F}) develops a peak at the glass transition temperature Tg and that the large force inhomogeneities, responsible for structural arrest in granular materials, are related to dynamical heterogeneities in supercooled liquids that form glasses. It has been further suggested that force chains present in granular materials may exist in supercooled liquids and may provide an order parameter for the glass transition. Our goal is to investigate the extent to which the forces experienced by particles in a glass-forming liquid are related to {SHD} and compare these forces to those observed in granular materials and other glass-forming systems. Our results are summarized as follows. We calculate {P(F}) for positive (repulsive) instantaneous forces and find no peak in {P(F}) at any temperature in our system, even below Tg. We also find that particles that have been localized for a long time are less likely to experience high relative force and that mobile particles experience higher relative forces at shorter time scales, indicating a correlation between pairwise forces and particle mobility. We construct force chains based on the magnitude of pairwise positive instantaneous forces. We find that force chains constructed in this manner are composed of both localized and mobile particles; therefore there is no one-to-one correspondence between force chains as defined here and locally mobile or immobile regions of the liquid. We also find that force chains do not play the same role as force chains in granular materials but may indicate a difference in the evolution of the local environment of particles with different mobility. We also discuss a possible relationship between force chains found here and the development of stringlike motion found in this and other glass-forming liquids [Phys. Rev. Lett. 1998, 80, 2338; J. Chem. Phys. 2004, 120, 4415].2,3},

The sequence and shape of the anisotropic particles are configured by exploiting a combination of confinement effects and microfluidics to pack precursor colloids with different properties into a narrow, terminal channel. The width and length of the channel relative to the particle size fully specify the configuration of the anisotropic particle that will be produced. The precursor spheres packed in the production zone are then permanently bonded into particles by thermal fusing. The flow in the production zone is reversed to release the particles for collection and use. Particles produced have linear chain structure with precisely configured, repeatable bond angles. With software programmable microfluidics, sequence and shape anisotropy are combined to yield synthesized homogeneous (type "A"), surfactantlike (type "{A-B}") or triblock (type "{A-B}-A") internal sequences in a single device. By controlling the dimensions of the microfluidic production zone, triangular prisms and particles with controlled roughness and patchiness are produced. The fabrication method is performed with precursors spheres with diameter as small as 3.0 m.},

The ability to obtain particle coordinates in bulk samples from micrographs is particularly appealing. In this paper we review and extend methods for optimal image formation of colloidal samples, which is vital for particle coordinates of the highest accuracy, and for extracting the most reliable coordinates from these images. We discuss in depth the accuracy of the coordinates, which is sensitive to the details of the colloidal system and the imaging system. Moreover, this accuracy can vary between particles, particularly in dense systems. We introduce a previously unreported error estimate and use it to develop an iterative method for finding particle coordinates. This individual-particle accuracy assessment also allows comparison between particle locations obtained from different experiments. Though aimed primarily at confocal microscopy studies of colloidal systems, the methods outlined here should transfer readily to many other feature extraction problems, especially where features may overlap one another.},

Our experimental results for the Lindemann melting criterion, the radial distribution function, the bond order parameter, and the statistics of topological changes at the particle level are the same as those found in simulations of equilibrium hard disks. This direct mapping suggests that the study of equilibrium systems can be effectively applied to study nonequilibrium steady states such as those found in our driven and dissipative granular system.},

Contrary to un-cross-linked particles, these cross-linked colloids are stable in good solvents for {PMMA} as well. Therefore we studied the properties of the cross-linked {PMMA} particles in the good solvents tetrahydrofuran ({THF}), chloroform, and toluene using light scattering and confocal scanning laser microscopy. We show that the particles swell instantaneously and that their volume can increase up to more than seven times their volume in poor solvents. Further, it is very likely that the particles are charged in {THF}.},

Here we report the first systematic experimental study on confinement effects on a liquid-liquid transition of a molecular liquid. We found that one liquid can be transformed into another purely by spatial confinement. This indicates that the liquid state cannot be specified by the temperature and pressure alone, but it is also affected by its size in a discontinuous manner: the phase of a liquid in a narrow space can, in principle, be different from that in the bulk. This finding would deepen our basic understanding of the liquid state.},

The procedureconsists of the coupling of the dye to a silane coupling agent, (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane, and thecontrollable incorporation of the reaction product into the silica sphere. The silica spheres are preparedfrom tetraethoxysilane in mixtures of ammonia, water, and ethanol. The composition of the silica spherescan be controlled in such a way that the organic groups can be placed on the surface, in a thin shell insidethe particle or distributed through the volume of an inner core. Fluorescein isothiocyanate was used tomake easily bleachable, fluorescent silica spheres. Hydrophilic charge stabilized and organophilic stericallystabilized 1-octadecanol-coated dyed silica systems were synthesized and dispersed in several solvents. Allthe particles were characterized after the several reaction steps by static and dynamic light scattering andtransmission electron microscopy. The fluorescent spheres were further characterized by fluorescencespectroscopy and confocal scanning laser fluorescence microscopy. Great effort was taken to preparemonodisperse dispersions free of clusters of particles. Such model dispersions are required for (scattering)studies of interparticle interactions in (concentrated) systems. Therefore, the several steps of the synthesisand optical characterization are described in detail.},

The static structure factors correspond to the appropriate theoretical models, {Percus–Yevick} and rescaled mean spherical approximation. At volume fractions = 0.18 a glass transition for the charged systems and at = 0.53 for the hard spheres can be observed, as evident from the nondecaying components of the intermediate scattering functions. In the glassy state the experimental correlation functions agree with the predictions of the mode-coupling theory over several orders of magnitude in time. Using the fitted experimental structure factors as input for the mode-coupling theory we find good agreement between the theoretical nonergodicity parameters and the measured {Debye–Waller} factors. In the liquid state close to the glass transition the experimental intermediate scattering functions and the predictions of the mode-coupling theory for the  and  relaxation are compared within a large Q range.

@article{Sansom1996Water,
    abstract = {Ion channels contain narrow columns of water molecules. It is of interest to compare the structure and dynamics of such intrapore water with those of the bulk solvent. Molecular dynamics simulations of modified {TIP3P} water molecules confined within channel-like cavities have been performed and the orientation and dynamics of the water molecules analyzed. Channels were modeled as cylindrical cavities with lengths ranging from 15 to 60 A and radii from 3 to 12 A. At the end of the molecular dynamics simulations water molecules were observed to be ordered into approximately concentric cylindrical shells. The waters of the outermost shell were oriented such that their dipoles were on average perpendicular to the normal of the wall of the cavity. Water dynamics were analyzed in terms of self-diffusion coefficients and rotational reorientation rates. For cavities of radii 3 and 6 A, water mobility was reduced relative to that of simulated bulk water. For 9- and {12-A} radii confined water molecules exhibited mobilities comparable with that of the bulk solvent. If water molecules were confined within an hourglass-shaped cavity (with a central radius of 3 A increasing to 12 A at either end) a gradient of water mobility was observed along the cavity axis. Thus, water within simple models of transbilayer channels exhibits perturbations of structure and dynamics relative to bulk water. In particular the reduction of rotational reorientation rate is expected to alter the local dielectric constant within a transbilayer pore.},

    abstract = {Single particle dynamics of water confined in a nanopore is studied through computer molecular dynamics. The pore is modeled to represent the average properties of a pore of Vycor glass. Dynamics is analyzed at different hydration levels and upon supercooling. At all hydration levels and all temperatures investigated a layering effect is observed due to the strong hydrophilicity of the substrate. The time density correlators show, already at ambient temperature, strong deviations from the Debye and the stretched exponential behavior. Both on decreasing hydration level and upon supercooling we find features that can be related to the cage effect typical of a supercooled liquid undergoing a kinetic glass transition. Nonetheless the behavior predicted by mode coupling theory can be observed only by carrying out a proper shell analysis of the density correlators. Water molecules within the first two layers from the substrate are in a glassy state already at ambient temperature (bound water). The remaining subset of molecules (free water) undergoes a kinetic glass transition; the relaxation of the density correlators agree with the main predictions of the theory. From our data we can predict the temperature of structural arrest of free water. \&copy;2000 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Mazza2007Connection,
    abstract = {We study the {Stokes-Einstein} ({SE}) and the {Stokes-Einstein}-Debye ({SED}) relations, {Dt=kBT}∕{6πηR} and {Dr=kBT}∕{8πηR3}, where Dt and Dr are the translational and rotational diffusivity, respectively, T is the temperature, η the viscosity, {kB} the Boltzmann constant, and R the  ” molecular” radius. Our results are based on molecular dynamics simulations of the extended simple point charge model of water. We find that both the {SE} and {SED} relations break down at low temperature. To explore the relationship between these breakdowns and dynamical heterogeneities ({DHs}), we also calculate the {SE} and {SED} relations for subsets of the 7\%  ” fastest” and 7\%  ” slowest” molecules. We find that the {SE} and {SED} relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur on all scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized phenomena, in contrast with a view where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown of the {SE} and {SED} relations, embedded in an inactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the {SE} and {SED} relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with  ” fractional” {SE} and {SED} relations, {Dt∼(τ∕T})−ξt and {Dr∼(τ∕T})−ξr, where ξt≈0.84(<1) and ξr≈0.75(<1). We also find that there is a decoupling between rotational and translational motion, and that this decoupling occurs in both the fastest and slowest subsets of molecules. Further, we find that, the decoupling increases upon cooling, but that the probability of a molecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also increases. To study the effect of time scale for {SE} and {SED} breakdown and decoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the {SE} and {SED} relations, and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Our results suggest that both the decoupling and {SE} and {SED} breakdowns originate at a time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, when diffusion starts. This is also the time scale when the {DHs} are more relevant. Our work also demonstrates that selecting {DHs} on the basis of translational or rotational motion more strongly biases the calculation of diffusion constants than other dynamical properties such as relaxation times.},

Functional behavior of polymeric particles in these fields is strongly influenced by their shape. However, the availability of precisely shaped polymeric particles has been a major bottleneck in understanding and capitalizing on the role of shape in particle function. Here we report a method that directly addresses this need. Our method uses routine laboratory chemicals and equipment to make particles with >20 distinct shapes and characteristic features ranging in size from 60 nm to 30 μm. This method offers independent control over important particle properties such as size and shape, which is crucial to the development of nonspherical particles both as tools and products for a variety of fields.},

    abstract = {Supercooled water exhibits a breakdown of the {Stokes–Einstein} relation between the diffusion constant D and the alpha relaxation time τα. For water simulated with two different potentials, {TIP5P} and {ST2}, we find that the temperature of the decoupling of diffusion and alpha relaxation correlates with the temperature of the maximum in specific heat that corresponds to crossing the Widom line T {W(P}). Specifically, we find that our results for {Dτα/T} collapse onto a single  ” master curve” if temperature is replaced by T − T {W(P}). We further find that the size of the mobile molecule clusters (dynamical heterogeneities) increases sharply near T {W(P}). Moreover, our calculations of mobile particle cluster size <n(t*)>w for different pressures, where t* is the time for which the mobile particle cluster size is largest, also collapse onto a single master curve if T is replaced by T − T {W(P}). The crossover to a more locally structured low density liquid ({LDL}) as T → T {W(P}) appears to be well correlated both with the breakdown of the {Stokes–Einstein} relation and with the growth of dynamic heterogeneities. Our results are consistent with the possibility that the breakdown of the {SE} relation in supercooled water at low pressures is associated with the hypothesized liquid–liquid phase transition.},

    abstract = {Colloids have increasingly been used to characterize or mimic many aspects of atomic and molecular systems. With confocal microscopy these colloidal particles can be tracked spatially in three dimensions with great precision over large time scales. This review discusses equilibrium phases such as crystals and liquids, and non-equilibrium phases such as glasses and gels. The phases that form depend strongly on the type of particle interaction that dominates. Hard-sphere-like colloids are the simplest, and interactions such as the attractive depletion force and electrostatic repulsion result in more non-trivial phases which can better model molecular materials. Furthermore, shearing or otherwise externally forcing these colloids while under microscopic observation helps connect the microscopic particle dynamics to the macroscopic flow behaviour. Finally, directions of future research in this field are discussed.},

    abstract = {We report on the preparation of monodisperse, fluorescent hematitesilica coreshell ellipsoids, with adjustable shapes ranging from spindles to nearly spheres, that are suitable for optical rotational diffusion studies. Hematite cores are grafted with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) which ensures colloidal stability during the silica coating provided by the base-catalyzed hydrolysis and polymerization of tetraethoxysilane. Using tetramethylammonium hydroxide as base instead of the volatile ammonia facilitates continuous seeded growth of silica to colloids with a desired aspect ratio. A convenient feature of the hematitesilica particles is the rapid dissolution of the iron oxide core by acid, producing hollow silica ellipsoids that can be optically matched to near transparency. The control of shape and size of the silica ellipsoids, their optical properties, and the fairly high yield in comparison to other preparation methods for nonspherical model colloids make the ellipsoids very suitable for quantitative studies. As a case in point, we have measured the rotational diffusion coefficient of fluorescent ellipsoids with rotational fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Dye-labeled ellipsoids can be imaged with confocal microscopy.},

Using collective flow variables, an analogous expression has been derived for {1/(T},), the inverse of shear viscosity. The {Stokes-Einstein} relation for liquids declares that D and T/ should have a fixed ratio as T and vary, but experiment reveals substantial violations for deeply supercooled liquids. Upon analyzing the self-diffusion and viscous flow processes in terms of configuration space inherent structures and kinetic transitions between their basins, one possible mechanism for this violation emerges. This stems from the fact that interbasin transitions become increasingly Markovian as T declines, and though self-diffusion is possible in a purely Markovian regime, shear viscosity in the present formulation intrinsically relies on successive correlated transitions.},

We relate the average mass n* of mobile particle clusters to the diffusion constant, D, and the configurational entropy, Sconf. We find that n* can be interpreted as the mass of the ?cooperatively rearranging regions? hypothesized in the {Adam?Gibbs} theory of the dynamics of supercooled liquids. In the context of the potential energy landscape ({PEL}) approach, the diffusion of molecules is related to the change of basins. By studying the dynamics of the system on the {PEL}, we identify clusters formed by the molecules with large displacements as the system visits consecutive local minima on the {PEL}.

@article{Kim2004Mechanism,
    abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation and analysis based upon the many-body potential energy landscape ({PEL}) are employed to characterize single molecule reorientation and structural relaxation, and their interrelation, in deeply supercooled liquid {CS2}. The rotational mechanism changes from small-step Debye diffusion to sudden large angle reorientation ({SLAR}) as the temperature falls below the mode-coupling temperature Tc. The onset of {SLAR} is explained in terms of the {PEL}; it is an essential feature of {low-T} rotational dynamics, along with the related phenomena of dynamic heterogeneity and the bifurcation of slow and fast relaxation processes. A long trajectory in which the system is initially trapped in a low energy local minimum, and eventually escapes, is followed in detail, both on the {PEL} and in real space. During the trapped period, \&quot;return\&quot; dynamics occurs, always leading back to the trap. Structural relaxation is identified with irreversible escape to a new trap. These processes lead to weak and strong {SLAR}, respectively; strong {SLAR} is a clear signal of structural relaxation. Return dynamics involves small groups of two to four molecules, while a string-like structure composed of all the active groups participates in the escape. It is proposed that, rather than simple, nearly instantaneous, one-dimensional barrier crossings, relaxation involves activation of the system to the complex, multidimensional region on the borders of the basins of attraction of the minima for an extended period. \&copy;2004 American Institute of Physics.},

    abstract = {Using molecular-dynamics computer simulations; we investigate the dynamics of the rotational degrees of freedom in a supercooled system composed of rigid; diatomic molecules. The interaction between the molecules is given by the sum of interaction-site potentials of the {Lennard-Jones} type. In agreement with mode-coupling theory ({MCT}); we find that the relaxation times of the orientational time correlation functions  C 1 ( s ) ( t );  C 2 ( s ) ( t ); and  C 1 ( t ) show at low temperatures a power law with the same critical temperature  T c ; which is also identical to the critical temperature for the translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to {MCT}; we find; however; that for these correlators the time-temperature superposition principle does not hold well and also the critical exponent γ depends on the correlator. For  C l ( s )  with  l =3;…;6 this principle does hold. We also study the temperature dependence of the rotational diffusion constant  D r  and demonstrate that at high temperatures  D r  is proportional to the translational diffusion constant  D  and when the system starts to become supercooled the former shows an Arrhenius behavior; whereas the latter exhibits a power-law dependence. We discuss the origin for the difference in the temperature dependence of  D  (or the relaxation times of  C l ( s ) ) and  D r . Finally; we present results that show that at low temperatures 180° flips of the molecule are an important component of the relaxation dynamics for the orientational degrees of freedom.},

We find that the position of a rotational heterogeneity is strongly correlated with the position of a translational heterogeneity, and that the fraction of molecules belonging to both kinds of heterogeneities increases with decreasing temperature.

From the analysis of local {Debye-Waller} factors, it is evident that the change in the dynamics of the {LJ} system is heterogeneous, with the largest perturbations close to the probes.

The resulting change of the rotational dynamics of the magnetic microspheres in a weak alternating field was measured from low to high volume fraction in ethanol, using a frequency-dependent complex magnetic susceptibility setup. At low volume fractions, the increased dipolar attraction slows down Brownian rotation. At higher volume fractions, however, rotation is no longer slowed down as rapidly with increasing concentration, likely due to dipolar coupling between the particles which accelerates their partial alignment with the alternating field. This explanation is supported by the unexpected finding that salt addition accelerates particle rotation rather than slowing it down. At the highest volume fraction, colloidal crystals and glasses were formed in which only a small fraction of the spheres exhibit rotational mobility.},

(Manoharan, V. N.; Elsesser, M. T.; Pine, D. J. Science 2003, 301, 483), is based on the encapsulation of silica spheres in emulsion droplets. The originality of our work lies in the preparation of monodisperse emulsions, which allows us to obtain some high yields of small aggregates over a wide range of conditions. Using optical microscopy and disk centrifugation, we show that the relative fractions of 2, 3, and 4 particle aggregates are controlled by the emulsification conditions, particularly the concentration of silica in the dispersed phase. Our best yields are obtained using low to moderate shear rates, a highly viscous continuous phase, and intermediate amounts of silica. The sedimentation of the colloidal solution into a gradient of concentration leads to aqueous suspensions of identical clusters. Since the overall process can easily be scaled up, large quantities of identical clusters may be prepared, which should allow the thermodynamic properties of these new colloidal objects to be measured for the first time. These nonspherical particles could serve as building blocks for more complex assemblies, such as colloidal crystals which could find applications as photonic materials.},

Quadratic and third-order invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow quantitative measures of cluster symmetries in these systems. A state with short-range translational order, but extended correlations in the orientations of particle clusters, starts to develop about 10\% below the equilibrium melting temperature in a supercooled {Lennard-Jones} liquid. The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model. In contrast, we find essentially perfect icosahedral bond correlations in alternative "amorphon" cluster models of glass structure.},

@article{Ilett1995Phase,

The key parameter that determines the topology of the phase diagram is the ratio ξ=rg/a of the radius of gyration (rg) of the polymer molecules to the radius (a) of the colloidal particles. At small ξ, the addition of the polymer simply expands the colloidal fluid-crystal coexistence region of the pure hard-sphere system. For larger values of ξ, however, a three-phase coexistence of colloidal gas, liquid, and crystal phases is observed. The crossover between the two topologies is found at ξ∼0.25. These experimental observations are compared with the predictions of a recent statistical mechanical theory for such mixtures [Lekkerkerker et al., Europhys. Lett. 20, 559 (1992)]. The relevance of our results to the current debate about the conditions necessary for the existence of a ''liquid'' state is discussed.},

Crystallization is heterogeneously nucleated by the smooth walls of the sample container. This process is analogous to the solidification of conventional materials during casting or liquid phase epitaxy. The nonequilibrium freezing transition proceeds through the gradual formation of a layered fluid near the repulsive wall, subsequent evolution of local order within the first fluid layer, and ultimately rapid crystallization. After nucleation and initial growth, crystallites are observed to fracture, perhaps due to shear stresses imposed by neighboring crystallites. Microscopic measurements of the nonequilibrium self‐diffusion coefficient are consistent with the dynamical freezing criterion recently proposed for systems in equilibrium by L\"{o}wen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 1557 (1993)].},

@article{Hyde1990Nanosecond,
    abstract = {Time-resolved optical measurements of probe reorientation in orthoterphenyl have been performed. Rotational correlation functions have been measured from 100 ps to 1 ms for anthracene and anthanthrene, while correlation functions were observed over a narrower time window for 9-phenylanthracene and 9,10-diphenylanthracene. The rotational correlation time of anthracene follows the temperature dependence of /T, indicating that anthracene rotation is well coupled to the dynamics responsible for the main glass transition. At temperatures above 30 \&{deg;C}, rotational correlation times depend upon probe size. In this region, orthoterphenyl behaves as a simple liquid. At temperatures near \&minus;5 \&{deg;C}, observed rotational correlation times are roughly independent of probe size. These results are consistent with the existence of domains of associated orthoterphenyl molecules. At lower temperatures, near and below the glass transition temperature, a partial reorientation of anthracene associated with the  process is observed. These results imply that the  process in orthoterphenyl involves the partial reorientation of most molecules rather than the total reorientation of a small fraction of the molecules.

The spectrum of density fluctuations around the steady state value provides a probe of the internal relaxation dynamics of the system and a link to recent thermodynamic theories for the settling of granular material. In particular; we propose a method to evaluate the compactivity of a powder; first put forth by Edwards and co-workers; that is the analog to temperature for a quasistatic powder.

The suitability of the tracer was investigated by a combination of spectral and time-resolved fluorescence and phosphorescence measurements. The phosphorescence quantum yield of dye molecules is high, because they are effectively shielded for quenching by oxygen or solute molecules, though some oxygen and water may penetrate the silica sphere. Both energy transfer between eosin molecules and internal rotational mobility of eosin cause a limited decay of the initial phosphorescence anisotropy. Finally, the hydrodynamic radius of the tracer found from the time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy experiment coincides with the value found by dynamic light scattering experiments. Our results show that silica tracer spheres tagged with eosin are suitable tracers for rotational diffusion measurements.},

The tracer diffusion coefficients in sphere dispersions agree with hard-sphere predictions, demonstrating that {TPA} is a reliable technique for studying rotational dynamics. We also assess the rotational diffusion of phosphorescent tracers in sphere packings, exploiting the fact that the {TPA} technique can be used for slightly turbid samples. We find that the fraction of immobilized tracers directly reflects the pore size distribution as extracted from the Voronoi construction of a simulated random close packing. A calculation of the average distance between tracer and neighboring particle shows that the dependence of the rotational diffusion coefficient on the average distance between tracer and medium spheres is stronger for packings than for dispersions.},

@article{Goldstein1969Viscous,
    abstract = {Recent attempts have been made to assess the relative merits of the free volume and entropy theories of viscous flow in glass‐forming liquids by accurate measurement of viscosity over wide temperature ranges, and subsequent comparison with the equations derived from these theories. In the author's view, this effort is misguided. The theories are crude and qualitative, and such tests are too stringent. It is better to make qualitative or semiquantitative comparison of a wide variety of physical phenomena; judged by this criterion, the entropy theory appears more successful. It is conjectured that further progress can be made by accepting the crude, naive character of any model we are likely to find tractable for the foreseeable future, and recognizing both the values and limitations of such models. A picture of the flow process in viscous liquids is proposed, in an attempt to answer certain questions about the molecular steps in flow either answered unsuccessfully or ignored by present theories, in the hope that it will lead a model closer to molecular reality but still sufficiently tractable to allow some range of predictive value. The model is based on the idea that in  ” viscous” liquids (shear relaxation time ≥10−9 sec) flow is dominated by potential barriers high compared to thermal energies, while at higher temperature, this will no longer be true. Certain concepts borrowed from the continuum theory of lattice defects are joined to a qualitative description of viscous flow due to Orowan, to provide a picture which leads to some qualitative predictions about flow and relaxation in the liquid and glassy states.},

We investigate the effects of the stabilizer molecular weight, stabilizer concentration, and monomer concentration on the particle size and polydispersity. We find that a minimum molecular weight of 10 000 g/mol is necessary to synthesize colloidally stable {PMMA} dispersions. The particle polydispersity is minimal (=5\%) for stabilizer to monomer weight ratios of 0.02 to 0.1, while {PMMA} particles prepared under conditions outside this range are polydisperse. The particle diameter can be varied from 0.4 to 1.5 µm by appropriate choices of stabilizer and monomer concentrations. Stable {PMMA} suspensions can be prepared at up to 26.3\% solids. The dispersions are stable in most liquid aliphatics, and are monodisperse enough to form ordered domains at high concentration. This single-stage synthesis, requiring only commercially available materials, may be of interest to those seeking a simple way to prepare highly monodisperse non-aqueous dispersions in the micron size range.},

@article{Angell1995Formation,
    abstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in {d<r2>dT}(<r2> is the {Debye-Waller} factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes ("bosons"), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature {TK}, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected.},

The generalized diffusion models are found to give a rather accurate representation of molecular reorientation in liquids and gases, as observed in the infrared and Raman spectra of simple molecules. One interesting feature of both the theoretical and experimental correlation functions is that the approach to rotational equilibrium often takes the form of a damped oscillation, rather than the monotonic decay which is usually assumed.

@article{Moroz2002Metallodielectric,
    abstract = {Diamond and zinc-blende photonic crystals are studied both in the purely dielectric case and in the presence of small inclusions of a low absorbing metal. It is shown that small metal inclusions can have a dramatic effect on the photonic band structure. Several complete photonic band gaps ({CPBG}'s) can open in the spectrum; between the second and third; fifth and sixth; and eighth and ninth bands. Unlike in the purely dielectric case; in the presence of small inclusions of a low absorbing metal the largest {CPBG} for a moderate dielectric constant (ɛ < \~{}10) turns out to be the second to third {CPBG}. The second to third {CPBG} is the most important {CPBG}; because it is the most stable against disorder. For a diamond and zinc-blende structure of nonoverlapping dielectric and metallo-dielectric spheres; a {CPBG} begins to decrease with an increasing dielectric contrast roughly at the point where another {CPBG} starts to open—a kind of gap competition. A {CPBG} can even shrink to zero when the dielectric contrast increases further. Metal inclusions have the biggest effect for the dielectric constant ɛ∈[2;12]; which is a typical dielectric constant at near infrared and in the visible for many materials; including semiconductors and polymers. It is shown that one can create a sizeable and robust second to third {CPBG} at near-infrared and visible wavelengths even for a photonic crystal which is composed of more than 97\% low refractive index materials ( n < \~{}1.45; i.e.; that of silica glass or a polymer). In the case of silica spheres with a silver core; the second to third {CPBG} opens for a metal volume fraction  f m ≈1.1\% and has a gap width to midgap frequency ratio of 5\% for  f m ≈2.5\%. Within the second to third {CPBG} of 5\%; absorption remains very small ( < \~{}2.6\% once the {CPBG} is centered at a wavelength λ > \~{}750 nm); which should be tolerable in most practical applications. The metallo-dielectric structures display a scalinglike behavior; which makes it possible to scale the {CPBG} from microwaves down to the ultraviolet wavelengths. Aluminum; copper; and gold cores yield almost identical results; provided that sphere radius  r s > \~{}250 nm. For  r s < 250 nm the results for different metals can be increasingly different with decreasing  r s ; nevertheless; qualitative features remain the same. These findings open the door for any semiconductor and polymer material to be used as genuine building blocks for the creation of photonic crystals with a {CPBG} and significantly increase the possibilities for experimentalists to realize a sizeable and robust {CPBG} in the near infrared and in the visible. One possibility is a construction method using optical tweezers; which is analyzed here.},

Well-ordered single binary colloidal crystals with a stoichiometry of large (L) and small (S) particles of {LS2} and {LS} were generated. In addition, we observed the formation of an {LS3superstructure}. The structures formed as a result of the templating effect of the first layer and the forces exerted by the surface tension of the drying liquid. By using spheres of different composition, one component can be selectively removed, as is demonstrated in the growth of a hexagonal non–close-packed colloidal crystal.},

@article{HidalgoAlvarez1996Electrokinetic,
    abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present some important advances in the electrokinetic and colloidal characterization of polymer colloids. Special attention is paid to the new electrokinetic techniques: diffusiophoresis, dielectric dispersion and electro-acoustic. Also the most recent theoretical approaches are reviewed with respect to the electrokinetic properties of polymer colloids. Recently there has been intense discussion concerning electrokinetic processes and the theories used for data interpretation. Several concerns have been raised relating to the inability of the different processes and theories to yield the same electrokinetic potential. The most important explanations (shear plane expansion, preferential ion adsorption, osmotic swelling, crossing of the mobility/[xi]-potential and anomalous surface conductance) to the electrokinetic behaviour of polymer colloids are discussed and analyzed. Also the effect of heat treatment on the electrokinetic properties of different types of polymer colloids is extensively considered. With regard to the colloidal stability of polymer colloids, three- and two-dimensional aggregations are presented. First, the stability factor W is introduced using the classical theory {DLVO} and the values obtained of Hamaker constant compared with the theoretical values estimated from the Lifshitz theory. The differences usually found by several authors are explained as due to the hydrodynamic interaction. Special attention is paid to the extended {DLVO} theory for studying homocoagulation of polymer colloids in three dimensions and to the new expressions for the van der Waals, electrostatic and structural forces that must be deduced to study the colloidal stability of polymer colloids in two dimensions. Also, the heterocoagulation of polymer colloids with different sign of surface charge density and particle size is reviewed, and a new definition of the heterocoagulation stability factor is given. The aggregation kinetics of polymer colloids in three dimensions is analyzed using the Smoluchowski theory (in terms of the reaction kernels kij) in the cases where the Smoluchowski's equation is analytically solvable (constant, sum, product kernel and linear combinations thereof). The dynamic scaling in aggregation phenomena with polymer colloids is studied using the classification scheme for homogeneous kernels due to Van Dongen and Ernst based on the relative probabilities of large clusters sticking to large clusters, and small clusters sticking to large clusters. The techniques (multiparticle and single particle detection) enabling us to provide cluster-size distribution of aggregating polymer colloids are also presented. Finally, the aggregation kinetics of two dimensional aggregation of polymer colloids is studied on the basis of the fractal dimension of the aggregates. The different scaling theories for two-dimensional aggregation are also considered.},

    abstract = {Some of the physicochemical mechanisms governing the stability of oil/water emulsions in the presence of fine particles are investigated. The thermodynamics of particle partitioning between a continuous aqueous phase and the oil /water interfaces of the emulsion droplets is analyzed. An isolated particle with an appropriate three-phase contact angle is trapped in a deep energy well at the interface of an oil/water emulsion droplet. This is consistent with the experimental observations that a close-packed two-dimensional structure of particles is formed on the oil/water interfaces of emulsion droplets stabilized by particles. In equilibrium partitioning the energy depth of a single interfacial particle should be balanced by net repulsive interactions between neighbouring particles on the interface. Electric double layer and short-range salvation and solid elastic forces between the interfacial particles are found to be insufficient to provide the required large repulsive interaction.},

Microgel particles are cross-linked latex particles that are swollen in a good solvent. The particles are conveniently prepared by surfactant-free emulsion polymerisation ({SFEP}) and may be viewed as sterically stabilised particles without a core. The narrow particle size distribution combined with the inherent steric stabilisation of particles prepared by {SFEP} makes them ideal model systems for the study of solution-dependent phenomena (e.g. osmotic de-swelling). The {poly(NIPAM}) ({NIPAM}=N-isopropylacrylamide) microgel system is considered in detail in terms of swelling, rheological, small-angle neutron scattering ({SANS}) and kinetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of the internal structure for microgel particles and consideration of areas for further research.},

    abstract = {Dynamic light-scattering measurements are reported for suspensions at concentrations in the vicinity of the glass transition. In a mixture of identically sized but optically different particles having hard-sphere-like interactions, we project out the incoherent (or self-) intermediate scattering functions by adjusting the refractive index of the suspending liquid until scattering from the structure is suppressed. Due to polydispersity, crystallization is sufficiently slow so that good estimates of ensemble-averaged quantities can be measured for the metastable fluid states. Crystallization of the suspensions is still exploited, however, to set the volume fraction scale in terms of effective hard spheres and to eliminate (coherent) scattering from the structure. The glass-transition volume fraction is identified by the value where large-scale particle motion ceases. The nonequilibrium nature of the glass state is evidenced by the dependence on the waiting time of the long time decay of the relaxation functions. The self-intermediate scattering functions show negligible deviation from Gaussian behavior up to the onset of large-scale diffusion in the fluid or the onset of waiting time effects in the glass.},

The pair-correlation function and the constant of self-diffusion are found to agree well with experiment; the latter is 15\% lower than the experimental value. The spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function shows a broad maximum in the frequency region {ω=0.25(kBT}/ℏ). The shape of the Van Hove function Gs(r, t) attains a maximum departure from a Gaussian at about t=3.0×10-12 sec and becomes a Gaussian again at about 10-11 sec. The Van Hove function Gd(r, t) has been compared with the convolution approximation of Vineyard, showing that this approximation gives a too rapid decay of Gd(r, t) with time. A delayed-convolution approximation has been suggested which gives a better fit with Gd(r, t); this delayed convolution makes Gd(r, t) decay as t4 at short times and as t at long times.},

@article{vanMegen1994Glass,
    abstract = {Suspensions of identical particles with hard-sphere-like interactions are studied at concentrations for which the equilibrium state is crystalline. Dynamic light scattering measurements on these suspensions, in their metastable amorphous states prior to crystallization, identify the kinetic glass transition ({GT}) by the arrest of particle concentration fluctuations on the experimental time scale. This kinetic glass transition coincides with a spectacular change in the mechanism of crystallization from the formation of small crystals, which appear homogeneously nucleated throughout the sample at concentrations below the transition, to the growth, above the transition, of larger and highly asymmetric crystals whose shape and orientation depend on the shear history of the suspension. The intermediate scattering functions are measured over a time window spanning up to eight decades and for several wave vectors near the position of the main structure factor peak. From an analysis of the data in terms of the idealized version of mode-coupling theory, we conclude that both α and β processes are necessary to describe the slow structural relaxation in the fluid near the {GT}. The superposition principle of the α process, for the colloidal fluid, and the factorization property of the β process, for the colloidal fluid and glass, are verified.},

At the same volume fraction a glass transition is indicated independent of any theory through specific changes in the intensity fluctuation pattern. The long time self-diffusion coefficient, as determined by {FRS}, decreases over about three orders of magnitude in a small volume fraction interval between 0.55 and 0.68. However, traces of ergodicity restoring structure relaxation processes are found even beyond  c  =  g .},

'Colloidal fluids', in which there are significant short-range correlations between the positions of neighbouring particles, and 'colloidal crystals', which have long-range spatial order, have been investigated extensively.  We report here a detailed study of the phase diagram of suspensions of colloidal spheres which interact through a steep repulsive potential.  With increasing particle concentration we observed a progression from colloidal fluid, to fluid and crystal phases in coexistence, to fully crystallized samples.  At the highest concentrations we obtained very viscous samples in which full crystallization had not occurred after several months an in which the particles appeared to be arranged as an amorphous 'colloidal glass'.  The empirical phase diagram can be repoduced reasonably well by an effective hard-sphere model.  The observation of the colloidal glass phase is interesting both in itself and because of possible relevance to the manufacture of high-strength ceramics.},

@article{Kasper1998SelfDiffusion,
    abstract = {Optical video microscopy and digital image processing have been used to study the self-diffusion of colloidal particles with a hard-sphere potential. The colloid particles consist of cross-linked polymers and are dispersed in a good solvent to avoid aggregation. To investigate single particle motion in highly concentrated dispersions, a host−tracer system, consisting of two different kinds of polymer particles, has been designed:  the host particles are made of poly-t-butylacrylate (with ethanedioldiacrylate as cross-linker) and have the same refractive index as the employed solvent, 4-fluorotoluene. The tracer particles have a core−shell structure with a polystyrene core (cross-linked with m-diisopropenylbenzene) and a shell consisting of cross-linked poly-t-butylacrylate to match surface properties and interaction potential to those of the  ” invisible” particles. The motion of the strongly scattering core−shell particles ( ” tracer” particles) was observed by dark-field light microscopy. From the obtained particle trajectories, mean squared displacements, van Hove autocorrelation functions, and vector−vector correlation functions were calculated, yielding a direct real-space image of the  ” cage effect” at φ = 0.52 and of the transition to a glassy state between φ = 0.56 and φ = 0.60, as expected for a hard sphere system. The extracted long-time self-diffusion coefficients Dself,long are fully consistent with a recent theoretical prediction using full many-body hydrodynamics at φ ≤ 0.56 and a colloid glass transition at φg = 0.583. However, even at φ = 0.60, Dself,long seems to be still finite, possibly indicating the existence of long-time motion of colloidal particles even in the glassy state.},

@article{Marcus1999Experimental,
    abstract = {We report, from direct observation of particle trajectories as a function of time, the presence of stringlike cooperative motion in a quasi-two-dimensional liquid. We have used digital video microscopy to study the equilibrium dynamics of suspensions of sterically stabilized uncharged poly(methylmethacrylate) spheres confined in a thin glass cell. Our experiments reveal the existence, in semidilute and dense liquid states, of a transition in the qualitative dynamical behavior of the system. At short times particles undergo unhindered Brownian motion, at intermediate times they undergo uncorrelated binary collisions, and at long times these one-particle self-diffusive modes are coupled to collective longitudinal acoustic modes of the fluid, the signature of which is local fluctuating domains of enhanced particle mobility. We study the properties of these domains by examining the density dependence of the van Hove self-correlation function and its deviation from Gaussian behavior. We observe that periods of {non-Gaussian} behavior correlate precisely with the timing of events involved in the relaxation of  ” caged” particles and their nearest neighbors. In contrast with relaxation processes in supercooled liquids, the lifetime of dynamical heterogeneities in a dissipative colloidal suspension is found to shift towards shorter time scales with increasing particle density. During time periods for which a quasi-two-dimensional system follows Gaussian behavior, we observe that, as predicted by Cichocki and Felderhof [J. Phys. Condens. Matter  6 , 7287 (1994)], the time dependence of the evolution of the effective diffusion coefficient from its short time to its long time value has the form  (ln t )/ t .  This last finding is true for all observed particle densities. To our knowledge, these results are the first experimental verification of the existence of microscopic cooperativity and the predicted temporal evolution of the diffusion coefficient for Brownian motion in concentrated quasi-two-dimensional liquids.},

Particular emphasis is put on properties observed recently by neutron scattering and molecular dynamics studies within the mesoscopic time region. The data indicate the existence of a crossover temperature T c , located above the calorimetric glass transition temperature T g , where the transport properties change from those typical for a strongly coupled liquid to those characteristic for a glass. Near T c  the alpha -process is specified by {Debye-Waller} factor anomalies, power law divergences of the relaxation scale and a crossover from alpha -scale universality to decoupling of the various relaxation processes. The beta -process is characterized by a complete absence of correlations between spatial and temporal motion and unconventional scaling laws. There appear two fractal time decay processes and two divergent time scales if the cross over temperature is approached. The results of the mode coupling theory for the supercooled liquid dynamics are reviewed and shown to give a unified and partly quantitative description of the T c  anomalies.},

    abstract = {Large-amplitude, low-frequency electric fields can be used to burn spectral holes in the dielectric response of supercooled propylene carbonate and glycerol. This ability to selectively modify the dielectric response establishes that the {non-Debye} behavior results from a distribution of relaxation times. Refilling of the spectral hole was consistent with a single recovery time that coincided with the peak in the distribution. Moreover, refilling occurred without significant broadening, which indicates negligible direct exchange between the degrees of freedom that responded to the field. Nonresonant spectral hole burning facilitates direct investigation of the intrinsic response of systems that exhibit nonexponential relaxation.},

@article{Kivelson1994Frustrationlimited,
    abstract = {We present a continuum theory of frustration-limited clusters in one-component glass-forming liquids that accounts, in part, for the recently reported [Fischer et al., J. {Non-Cryst}. Solids, 131\&ndash;133, 134 (1991)], and quite unexpected, presence in simple glass-forming liquids of stable clusters at low temperatures (T) and the even less expected persistence for very long times of these clusters at higher T's. The model is based on the idea that there is a local structure that is energetically preferred over simple crystalline packing, which is strained (frustrated) over large distances; although in a curved space the preferred packing could lead to ``ideal'' crystallization at temperatures that are usually above the actual freezing temperature, in ``flat'' space this transition is narrowly avoided. We are led to a new ansatz for the T dependence of the viscosity, which permits us to collapse data for many liquids onto a universal curve.

    abstract = {A molecular‐kinetic theory, which explains the temperature dependence of relaxation behavior in glass‐forming liquids in terms of the temperature variation of the size of the cooperatively rearranging region, is presented. The size of this cooperatively rearranging region is shown to be determined by configuration restrictions in these glass‐forming liquids and is expressed in terms of their configurational entropy. The result of the theory is a relation practically coinciding with the empirical {WLF} equation. Application of the theory to viscosimetric experiments permits evaluation of the ratio of the kinetic glass temperature Tg (derived from usual ``quasistatic'' experiments) to the equilibrium second‐order transition temperature T2 (indicated by either statistical‐mechanical theory or extrapolations of experimental data) as well as the hindrance‐free energy per molecule. These parameters have been evaluated for fifteen substances, the experimental data for which were available. Hindrance‐free energies were found to be of the magnitude to be expected from consideration of molecular interaction energies. The values of {Tg/T2} thus obtained for these fifteen widely differing materials were found to be nearly the same, i.e., 1.30±8.4\%. Values for {Tg/T2} of nearly the same magnitude were derived by Bestul and Chang from calorimetric data.},

As a liquid is cooled far below its melting point, dynamics in some regions of the sample can be orders of magnitude faster than dynamics in other regions only a few nanometers away. In this review, the experimental work that characterizes this heterogeneity is described. In particular, the following questions are addressed: How large are the heterogeneities? How long do they last? How much do dynamics vary between the fastest and slowest regions? Why do these heterogeneities arise? The answers to these questions influence practical applications of glass-forming materials, including polymers, metallic glasses, and pharmaceuticals.},

@article{Cicerone1995How,
    abstract = {Time resolved optical spectroscopy was used to observe molecular rotation over more than 14 decades in time for six probes in o‐terphenyl ({OTP}). In contrast to previous studies, probe rotation times are found to depend significantly upon probe size in the deeply supercooled regime. Systematic deviations from the temperature dependence of the {Debye–Stokes}–Einstein equation are observed, however, these deviations are relatively small. These observations are inconsistent with some models of cooperative molecular motion near Tg which invoke rigid aggregates or locally liquidlike regions. The width of the relaxation spectrum (characterized by the {KWW} β parameter) systematically decreases with increasing probe size. Near Tg, the largest probe (rubrene) rotates with nearly a single exponential correlation function. Based on the observed trend in β, it is estimated that {OTP} is homogeneous on length scales greater than 2.5 nm at Tg. {\copyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

The nonexponential rotational relaxation of the probe molecules is shown to be due, at least in part, to the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the host dynamics. Under appropriate photobleaching conditions, a nonequilibrium distribution of probe molecule mobilities can be created by preferentially bleaching the more mobile probe molecules in a sample. Near Tg this nonequilibrium distribution is observed to return to an equilibrium distribution of relaxation times over times on the order of 103 τc, where τc is the average rotational correlation time of a probe molecule. The time required to return to equilibrium is interpreted as a structural relaxation time for dynamic heterogeneities in {OTP}. {\copyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Sillescu1996Comment,
    abstract = {F. H. Stillinger and J. A. Hodgdon [Phys. Rev. E  50 ; 2064 (1994)] have proposed a ''fluidized domain'' model to explain that the diffusion coefficient ratio  D trans / D rot  increases by a factor of ∼10 2  on approaching the glass transition from above in fragile liquids. In their numerical estimates they make ad hoc assumptions that lead to a very small volume fraction φ 0 ∼10 -5  of the fluidized domains. It is shown how these assumptions can be avoided and φ 0 ∼10 -1  results from experimental values of  D trans ;  D rot ; and the width of the  D rot  distribution. A modification of the {Stillinger-Hodgdon} model can be derived from the two-state model of Beckert and Pfeifer [Ann. Phys. (Leipzig)  16 ; 262 (1965)] and yields experimental estimates of a few nanometers for the fluidized domains. {\copyright}  1996 The American Physical Society.},

These structures can be fluorescently labeled, which can serve as a probe to monitor their dynamics in complex environments. The metal coating modulates fluorescence emission as these structures rotate in suspension. By analyzing the time sequence of fluorescence images using single-particle tracking techniques, here we measure the rotational dynamics of a rodlike tetramer, quantifying rotation along the long axis.},

    abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate translational and rotational diffusion in a rigid three-site model of the fragile glass former ortho-terphenyl, at {260\&nbsp;\&nbsp;KT346}\&{nbsp;\&nbsp;K} and ambient pressure. An Einstein formulation of rotational motion is presented, which supplements the commonly used Debye model. The latter is shown to break down at supercooled temperatures as the mechanism of molecular reorientation changes from small random steps to large infrequent orientational jumps. We find that the model system exhibits {non-Gaussian} behavior in translational and rotational motion, which strengthens upon supercooling. Examination of particle mobility reveals spatially heterogeneous dynamics in translation and rotation, with a strong spatial correlation between translationally and rotationally mobile particles. Application of the Einstein formalism to the analysis of translation-rotation decoupling results in a trend opposite to that seen in conventional approaches based on the Debye formalism, namely, an enhancement in the effective rate of rotational motion relative to translation upon supercooling.

Moreover, when injected into Xenopus embryos, the nanocrystal-micelles were stable, nontoxic (<5 x 10(9) nanocrystals per cell), cell autonomous, and slow to photobleach.

@article{Lellig2004Selfdiffusion,
    abstract = {The fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ({FRAP}) method and the
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ({FCS}) have been applied on
suspensions of highly charged colloidal spheres with a small content of
rod-shaped tobacco mosaic virus ({TMV}) particles. Since these methods
only determine the self-diffusion coefficient of the fluorescently
labeled species, {D<SUB}>{S</SUB}> of the rods and the spheres could
independently be measured. The ionic strength of the dispersion medium
has been varied to measure self-diffusion of rods and spheres in
dependence on the degree of order of the matrix spheres. In contrast to
{FRAP}, which allows the determination of the long-time self-diffusion
coefficient {D<SUB}>{S</SUB}><{SUP}>{L</SUP}>, {FCS} measures self-diffusion on a
shorter time scale. Thus a comparison of the results that were obtained
by {FCS} and {FRAP}, in combination with Brownian Dynamics simulations,
gives insight into the time dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient
of an interacting colloidal system. As the mean interparticle distance
of the matrix is of the same order of magnitude as the length of a {TMV}
rod, the rotational motion is influenced by the assembly of spheres
around a {TMV} particle. Since {FCS} is sensitive both to translational and
rotational motion, whereas {FRAP}, which probes the diffusion at much
larger length scales, is only sensitive to the translational motion of
{TMV}, the comparison of diffusion coefficients measured employing {FRAP}
and {FCS} can give some insights in the rotational diffusion: the
experimental data indicate a slowing down of the rotational motion of a
{TMV} rod with increasing structural order of the matrix spheres. \&\#169;

@article{Sciortino2005Glassy,
    abstract = {This review focuses on recent developments in the theoretical, numerical and experimental study of slow dynamics in colloidal systems, with a particular emphasis on the glass transition phenomenon. Colloidal systems appear to be particularly suited for tackling the general problem of dynamic arrest, since they show a larger flexibility compared to atomic and molecular glasses because of their size and the possibility of manipulating the physical and chemical properties of the samples. Indeed, a wealth of new effects, not easily observable in molecular liquids, have been predicted and measured in colloidal systems. The slow dynamic behavior of three classes of colloidal suspension is reviewed - hard colloids, short-range attractive colloids and soft colloidal systems - selecting the model systems among the most prominent candidates for grasping the essential features of dynamic arrest. Emphasis is on the possibility of performing a detailed comparison between experimental data and theoretical predictions based on the mode coupling theory of the glass transition. Finally, the importance of understanding the system's kinetic arrest phase diagram, i.e. the regions in phase space where disordered arrested states can be expected, is stressed. When and how these states are kinetically stabilized with respect to the ordered lowest free energy phases is then examined in order to provide a framework for interpreting and developing new ideas in the study of new materials.},

    abstract = {Monodisperse colloidal suspensions of micrometre-sized spheres are playing an increasingly important role as model systems to study, in real space, a variety of phenomena in condensed matter physics—such as glass transitions and crystal nucleation1, 2, 3, 4. But to date, no quantitative real-space studies have been performed on crystal melting, or have investigated systems with long-range repulsive potentials. Here we demonstrate a charge- and sterically stabilized colloidal suspension—poly(methyl methacrylate) spheres in a mixture of cycloheptyl (or cyclohexyl) bromide and decalin—where both the repulsive range and the anisotropy of the interparticle interaction potential can be controlled. This combination of two independent tuning parameters gives rise to a rich phase behaviour, with several unusual colloidal (liquid) crystalline phases, which we explore in real space by confocal microscopy. The softness of the interaction is tuned in this colloidal suspension by varying the solvent salt concentration; the anisotropic (dipolar) contribution to the interaction potential can be independently controlled with an external electric field ranging from a small perturbation to the point where it completely determines the phase behaviour. We also demonstrate that the electric field can be used as a pseudo-thermodynamic temperature switch to enable real-space studies of melting transitions. We expect studies of this colloidal model system to contribute to our understanding of, for example, electro- and magneto-rheological fluids.},

clusters form a sequence of structures at specific cluster sizes- a
precise packing sequence - that for small sizes is identical to that
observed in evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal spheres. We further
show that this sequence is reproduced and extended in simulations of two
simple models of spheres self-assembling from random initial conditions
subject to certain convexity constraints. This sequence contains six of
the most common virus capsid structures obtained in vivo including large
chiral clusters, and a cluster that may correspond to several
non-icosahedral, spherical virus capsid structures obtained in vivo. Our
findings suggest this precise packing sequence results from free energy
minimization subject to convexity constraints and is applicable to a

@electronic{Bazant2004Theory,
    abstract = {Dilute granular flows are routinely described by collisional kinetic theory,
but dense flows require a fundamentally different approach, due to
long-lasting, many-body contacts. In the case of silo drainage, many continuum
models have been developed for the mean flow, but no realistic statistical
theory is available. Here, we propose that particles undergo cooperative
displacements in response to diffusing ``spots'' of free volume. The typical
spot size is several particle diameters, so cages of nearest neighbors tend to
remain intact over large distances. The spot hypothesis relates diffusion and
cage-breaking to volume fluctuations and spatial velocity correlations, in
agreement with new experimental data. It also predicts density waves caused by
weak spot interactions. Spots enable fast, multiscale simulations of dense
flows, in which a small, internal relaxation enforces packing constraints
during spot-induced motion. In the continuum limit of the model, tracer
diffusion is described by a new stochastic differential equation, where the
drift velocity and diffusion tensor are coupled non-locally to the spot
density. The same mathematical formalism may also find applications to glassy
relaxation, as a compelling alternative to void (or hole) random walks.},

@article{Weeks1971Role,
    abstract = {The different roles the attractive and repulsive forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a {Lennard‐Jones} liquid are discussed. It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair‐correlation function) rather than the pair‐correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a {Lennard‐Jones} fluid. This reference system structure factor is calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate approximation described herein. The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription for calculating the radial distribution function of dense liquids which is more accurate than that obtained by any previously reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are presented in the form of calculations of the free energy, the internal energy (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from the virial equation). The implications of our conclusions to perturbation theories for liquids and to the interpretation of x‐ray scattering experiments are discussed.},

@article{Heyes1998Translational,
    abstract = {Molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations have been used to study the translational and rotational relaxation of model spherical nanocolloidal particles in solution at infinite dilution. The solvent was modelled at the molecular level. Simulations were carried out with two types of model nanocolloidal particle, one that was smooth (`structureless') and the other built from a cluster of atoms (`rough'). Both types had variable diameter, {IMG}, compared to that of the solvent molecule, {IMG}. The {Weeks-Chandler}-Andersen ({WCA}) interaction between the colloid and the {WCA} solvent molecules was used. Nanocolloidal particles that were up to an order of magnitude larger than those of the solvent molecules were simulated. The effects of the relative solvent and colloidal particle mass density, and colloid size on the translational and rotational self-diffusion coefficients were investigated. At liquid-like number densities {IMG} the translational, D , and rotational, {IMG}, self-diffusion coefficients for the nanocolloids of all sizes were statistically independent of the ratio of colloidal to solvent particle mass density for the the values, up to {IMG}, explored. As solvent number density decreased, the translational self-diffusion coefficients of the colloidal particles showed more evidence than the rotational self-diffusion coefficients of a decrease with increasing colloid particle density. Both D and {IMG} decreased with increasing size of the colloidal particle in close agreement with the classical solutions, the {Stokes-Einstein} and {Stokes-Einstein}-Debye relationships respectively. Differences in the translational diffusion coefficients of smooth and rough colloidal particles were not statistically significant at {IMG}, but at {IMG} the D were lower for the rough particles. Reorientational motion occurred by small-step diffusion.},

The analysis demonstrates how the contributions to the viscous dissipation tend to be underestimated in hydrodynamic considerations so that the geometrical values deduced from them come out too high. Experimental results for the torque on cylindrical rods and ellipsoids for a/b values from 3.5 to 30 are close to the theoretical results. For a/b\&gt;10 the difference is about 10\%; for shorter molecules 20\%. With the rotational diffusion constant given by {3kT} (\&\#151;)/8a3, where =log2a/b we obtain best fit with (\&gt;2)=1.57\&\#150;7 (1/\&\#151;0.28)2\&\#177;0.25. Experimental data for the rotational diffusion constant of a cylindrical virus (a/b=20) in water, obtained by {O'Konski} and Haltner agree with this result within 10\%.

A short-range attraction between spheres led to crystallites one to three layers thick. The spheres were tracked with optical microscopy while the attraction was reduced and the crystals sublimated. Large crystallites sublimated by escape of particles from the perimeter. The rate of shrinkage was greatly enhanced, however, when the size decreased to less than 20 to 50 particles, depending on the location in the phase diagram. At this size, the crystallites transformed into a dense amorphous structure, which rapidly vaporized. The enhancement of kinetics by metastable or unstable phases may play a major role in the melting, freezing, and annealing of crystals.},

    abstract = {We measure the current transported by a microscopic metallic sphere shuttling charge through a fluid between two electrodes. Metallic spheres with diameters of 90\&ndash;200\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&micro;m were formed by emulsification of the alloy wood's metal above its melting point in electrically insulating oil. Droplets of oil containing a single sphere in suspension were placed between two parallel electrodes. After a voltage was applied, the sphere conducted current through the oil by moving back and forth between the electrodes. The measured current was proportional to the voltage raised to a power that ranged between 3 for relatively high-viscosity silicone oil and slightly above 2 for hexadecane. The magnitude of the current and the frequency of the shuttling are well described across a broad range of parameters by a model that includes dissipation in the fluid at low Reynolds number. Discontinuous jumps in the conductance arise from the finite inertia of the particle, which leads to recoil from the electrodes at Stokes number of order ten.

Specifically; the diffusion constants  D trans  and  D rot  are proportional to  T /η( T ); where η is the shear viscosity. However; fragile glass formers seem to present a paradox: near the glass transition temperature  T g  this proportionality continues for  D rot ; but  D trans  can be enhanced by 10 2 . A ''fluidized domain'' model is proposed to explain these observations. Owing to a suitable combination of domain parameters (mean size; lifetime; concentration; internal viscosity); the observed diffusion rate discrepancy can indeed be rationalized. Rough estimates for these domain parameters are provided for two fragile glass formers (orthoterphenyl and 1;3;5-tri-α-naphthyl benzene) at their respective  T g 's.},

In a complementary manner, holographic video microscopy uses real-time recordings of in-line holograms to create time-resolved volumetric images of three-dimensional microstructures. The combination is exceptionally effective for organizing, inspecting and analyzing soft-matter systems.},

@article{Debenedetti2001Supercooled,
    abstract = {Glasses are disordered materials that lack the periodicity of crystals but behave mechanically like solids. The most common way of making a glass is by cooling a viscous liquid fast enough to avoid crystallization. Although this route to the vitreous state — supercooling — has been known for millennia, the molecular processes by which liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling are not fully understood. Here we discuss current theoretical knowledge of the manner in which intermolecular forces give rise to complex behaviour in supercooled liquids and glasses. An intriguing aspect of this behaviour is the apparent connection between dynamics and thermodynamics. The multidimensional potential energy surface as a function of particle coordinates (the energy landscape) offers a convenient viewpoint for the analysis and interpretation of supercooling and glass-formation phenomena. That much of this analysis is at present largely qualitative reflects the fact that precise computations of how viscous liquids sample their landscape have become possible only recently.},
